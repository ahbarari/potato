More info/ background in comments</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> So I've just got a letter from my diabetic specialist with my diagnosis on and those details on above and he's advised that I'm type 2 diabetic. Now a little background (also not a massive fan of this doctor as he told me he 'doesn't believe in type 3c diabetes' \n\n- March 2022 was hospitalised with pancreatis and necrotising pancreas. On arrival to the ward they took my blood for a HbA1c and it came back as 38. \n\n- In hospital for 3 months at 2 different hospitals. In those hospitals both diabetic teams told me I'm type 3c but to treat myself/ follow advice for type 1 as this is closer and there's not a lot of stuff online for type 3c's. \n\n- While in hospital I couldn't eat so was put on a feeding tube. This was super high in sugar to where I was on 70 units a day and my HbA1c in July was 97 \n\n- I know my HbA1c isn't great now but it's come down and I'm still struggling with my diagnosis/ life but I'm trying. \n\nI'm just struggling to understand why hrs said I'm type 2 from the information I have and know. Like if I wasn't diabetic before then my pancreas dies and now I am surely I'm pancreatic? I was also advised multiple times that I will be diabetic for life now and insulin dependant?<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> I'm no expert but here's my understanding of your tests.  \n\nNone of the  tests you've shown suggest you **are** type 2, rather they suggest you're **not** type 1.\n\nSo, the logical conclusion would be you have type 2 as that's extremely common,  but as you say you have 3c.\n\nYour A1c is high so you defo have diabetes. \n\nPresence of Anti GAD, transporter 8 or IA2 are possible indicators of type 1. \n\nYou don't have these which indicates you possibly don't have type 1. \n\nYour C peptide numbers are in normal range ( i think) which suggests you have normal beta cell function... which means you don't have type 1.\n\nI guess you will need blood work that suggests you're not type 2 to convince your doc 3c exists.  I don't know which tests though, as I'm not yet clued in enough about t2. Maybe something to do with your triglyceride levels.<br><br>\n"}

My nana on my mother\u2019s side at the age of 35. Here\u2019s the thing, I am 22 years old and I\u2019ve just been diagnosed with celiac disease. I found out online that T1D is much more prevalent in people with celiac. I was already worried I will develop it one day, but now I\u2019m extra worried. Since I have several risk factors, does anyone know just how likely it is that I will develop T1D? I found the risk factors for development with celiac disease & for having a parent with T1D, but nothing about both together. Pls let me know if I\u2019m posting in the wrong sub for this. I hope you\u2019re all doing well!!! :)</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Google trialnet. Depending on your age you are eligible for free risk screening.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> I wouldn't overly worry about it. It might happen and it might not. My advice is to get a glucose reader and do a quick test every so often, especially if you get any of the symptoms<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> If your father has T1 then you have a 1 in 17 chance of getting it.\n\nhttps://www.diabetes.org/diabetes/genetics-diabetes\n\nI don't know the statistics regarding celiac, but I think you might be misunderstanding this fact a bit. I don't think there's anything special about celiac as it relates to T1. Having ANY autoimmune disease makes you much more likely than the average person to have a second autoimmune disease. So that probably does make your odds somewhat worse than 1 in 17, but I couldn't say how much worse.\n\nStill though I wouldn't worry about it as there's nothing you can do to prevent it anyway - it will either happen or it won't. You can get tested if you like to see if you carry the gene that increases your risk of developing it. Otherwise all you can do is be aware of the symptoms and check yourself periodically so it can at least be caught early if it does happen.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> The age that your family members developed diabetes is quite late, and points to Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA), which occurs most often in ppl over the age of 30.  It is not typical T1D, as it progresses at a much slower rate, even though the end treatment is the same (insulin reliance).  You can do some research on LADA, and there are antibody tests that are used to confirm its diagnosis, but I\u2019m not sure if the tests can be used to predict your likelihood of developing it.  Some ppl on this sub have rather strong opinions about LADA vs T1D, so they may offer more info about it.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> My dad got it at 28.  His sister got it late 30s.  I got it at 46.  My siblings in their mid 40s don't have it.  I never knew I had a 1/17 chance.  I never worried about it.  I figured if it was coming it was coming and there wasn't a lot I could do about.  I lost the dice roll on it.  I'm dealing with it.  Do the TrialNet testing if it's something you can deal with.<br><br>\n"}

{"id": "tt9kjd", "text": "<div class='post' style='user-select:none;'>\n  <h2>Post</h2>\n  <p>How I Compiled A Perpetual Backup Cooling Plan For My Insulin Stash For Under $1,000\nEdit: if it\u2019s not clear from the post\u2026.I\u2019m talking about my two years worth of backup insulin, not my day to day stuff.\n\nThis came up in the comment section and after answering that, I thought I\u2019d make it a post. I compiled this after lots of research for my own peach of mind regarding a power outage.\n\nI\u2019m not a prepper by any means, but a power outage is my realistic worst case scenario for my insulin.\n\nIn the unlikely event of SHTF, camping, or roadtrips, this is also nice peace of mind.\n \nWhat I\u2019m going into here will be a wall of text and isn\u2019t exactly what you have to do, just putting my own conclusions up from my hours of research.\n\nMy personal budget was about $1,000 but I didn\u2019t accumulate everything at once, and this can be modified.\n\n1.\t\u2060POWER STATION - A power station is just awesome in general to have. Think like a battery pack you might carry for your phone, but with dramatically more capacity. They will come with regular outlets on-the-go which is convenient and usually include lots of USB ports for smaller things like phones/tablets/laptops. In my instance, my rabbit hole started because I wanted to find a way to backup cool my insulin if I ever lost power.\n\nThings I looked for in a power station (and you should too)\n\n\u2022\t\u2060LifeP04 (lithium iron phosphate) batteries and NOT standard lithium ion batteries we\u2019re used to in everyday life. LifeP04 batteries have two awesome benefits over lithium ion: 1) they can be recharged about 2500 times before losing capacity unlike lithium ion\u2019s which are usually cooked after about 500 [think like your cell phone that doesn\u2019t hold a charge as well as it did two years ago]. And 2) LifeP04 batteries are much more stable than lithium ion batteries in heat. If\u2019 I\u2019m ever moving around in my car and the summer sun has my trunk over 100 degrees, I have peace of mind knowing I don\u2019t have to worry about fire hazard.\n\u2022\t\u2060\n\n\nMINIMUM 500Wh CAPACITY: One thing you find is that a lot of random appliances require a shocking amount of energy. To have a viable option for a battery pack that won\u2019t be out of juice instantly, make sure it is appropriately sized.\n\u2022\t\u2060\n\n\nSOLAR CAPABILITY: Did you know you can buy nifty portable, light, solar panels that can charge your battery pack if it has the ability? This was really important to me because if we lost power, I wanted a way to produce enough energy that I could power a small fridge indefinitely off the sun for my peace of mind.\n\nPASS THROUGH CHARGING: Not all of these power stations can let you use your wall plugs while you are charging the station itself. If you buy a station with pass through charging, you can simultaneously charge the power station from your solar panels, while leaving your compressor fridge plugged in and running.\n\n\n\n2) COMPRESSOR FRIDGE - Did you know even a standard mini fridge can usually kill a big 500Wh power pack in a couple hours? That doesn\u2019t work for me if I need an insultin solution, so I looked into compressor fridges.\n\nThese are usually around the size of a cooler, but they have compressors that can keep them actively chilled. They plug in with a 12V car charger and only pull about 10W to run. This means, if I have a 500Wh battery pack, it can hold enough juice to keep my fridge running a couple days when without charging.\n\nEven if my battery packs can\u2019t recharge with my solar option (night/rain/cloudy), I can still plug the fridge into my car\u2019s 12v circle charger. HOW COOL IS THAT? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nSo here are some links of what I bought. You don\u2019t have to buy exactly what I did, but I\u2019ve been quite happy with my setup and am happy to vouch for it.\n\nIf anything, I hope this lights the urge in you to do your own exploring and see if you learn more.\n\nI cannot recommend JASONOID on YouTube enough as a cool resource for all this.\n\nBLUETTI EB55 (These sometimes go on sale) I caught mine on amazon for $399 https://www.amazon.com/BLUETTI-Portable-Generator-Regulated-Emergency/dp/B098LSKJHH\n\nSetpower 45L (used to be about $300.

I've backpacked for weeks before in tropical climates using only small Frio packs to store insulin, often without a fridge, and it did just fine but I fully understand that's not always the case.\n\nCool(heh) to prepare yourself. \u2744<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I\u2019ve been leaving insulin in a hot car during Florida summers for a decade but that\u2019s a neat idea.\n\nMore important thing in my opinion is to have a large enough stash of insulin to sustain yourself for a long time.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> I gotta admit I\u2019m impressed.

I see my othamogist  regularly and he hasn\u2019t made a comment about anything? I have regular scans, pressure taken, dilation.

I got cataract surgery at 35yo as a result of laser and high sugars putting them into overdrive. My opthamologist couldn\u2019t get a good view of my retina it was so cloudy, which is why I went ahead with it. \n\nI got to say, it was a good things for me. I went from -6.75 with HORRIBLE night vision and worsening colour vision (as a graphic artist this was an issue), to 20/20 vision with colours being bright again and nighttime vision restored. I need a light correction for small type (I wear readers while working) but am glasses free. The hardest part was being careful for the 4 months while things healed (no lifting over 10lb or leaning over for 2 months, then repeat for the other eye). I am very happy I had it done so young. \n\nI haven\u2019t had a vitrectomy. But I get eye shots ever 6-8 weeks in each eye still.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I was born with cataracts from an injection my mother got when she was pregnant with me. Doctor verified them when I was 9 at my 1st eye exam. Diagnosed w T1D when I was 12, back in 1975 before glucose monitors were invented. Cataracts didn\u2019t impair my vision until I was 35, so had left eye done first, only to learn I am allergic to the most common  eye anesthesia. Had an asshole of a surgeon who didn\u2019t believe me when I called after hours in severe pain & told me to \u201cbuck up and drink a beer\u201d. Was scheduled to have other eye done the next week, but refused to see same Dr, so waited 10 years & went down to U of M Kellogg Eye Center, where they used lidocaine instead of Preparacaine in my eye. Went great that time. Now I have better eyesight than I did when I was 9 years old!  Since I was young when I had the 1st one done, they used a multifocal  lens in my eye so I could see both distance & up close. When you have them done at older ages they don\u2019t use a multifocal lens unless you pay extra for them and you have to wear readers. I have only had a small bleed on my left retina after 49 years of T1D & only had laser treatments on that eye, so haven\u2019t had to have a Vitrectomy, so I don\u2019t know if that causes cataracts. If you aren\u2019t allergic to the anesthesia the surgery for cataracts is easy and so beneficial!!<br><br>\n"}

I\u2019m trying to understand this because from what I read on the internet calculating my insulin in take purely based on the carb amount I take is not correct and there are other things to include. Like fiber, protein etc.\n\nI\u2019m 28 y old and I have diabetes for 26 years. Previously I didn\u2019t need to count carbs because my life was very stabile. But now I\u2018m more active, like going to gym, eating outside with friends, work etc. So my eating habits and my life style changed a lot. So I\u2018m now more curious because for example this morning around 10-11 AM my glucose levels were around 120+ and I ate 2 slices of bread which each slice contains 26g carbs, a mix of eggs, tomato, onion and paprika food, some cheese, olive and butter. I took 4 units before and 2 units an hour later. Logically it should have been enough but after 3 hours my glucose levels were around 300 and I took 2 more units and it still going up.\n\nSo in general I am very confused and I want to understand better how should I calculate detailly my insulin need and what to consider or if there are any apps that would help me calculate insulin need better I would like to learn them. Like for example an app considers everything like protein, fiber and tells me this is how much I need or if someone here could tell me or provide me a source it would be great.\n\nThanks.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Waltzing the dragon has a formula for calculating fat and protein and the juicebox podcast has an episode on it. There is also an app called insulin calculator black square with blue circle that calculates for f&p. I havent compared it to doing the formula myself though. Experiment with your carb ratios as well.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> The entire 11 years I\u2019ve had type one Ive had an endocrinologist/diabetes specialist work out my ratios. I know there are ways of working it out yourself but my personal opinion is to trust a professional. Then again, I am in the UK and get my healthcare free and I know that\u2019s not the same for everyone. Just make sure that, if you have to work it out yourself, you do it safely and start small so you don\u2019t give yourself too much insulin. Take care of yourself!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I know this is not what you asked (sorry!), but how long do you take your insulin before you eat? I use novarapid and find taking it about 10 - 15 mins before most meals helps stop the spike in the first place. I think the time varies from person to person though and also the exact meal (like I know high fat slows down my digestion a lot).\n\nHaving said that, I know newer insulins such as fiasp start working more quickly and so you don't have to take them so far in advanced.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> learn about the glycemic index. sometimes you have to split up the dose throughout the duration of the meal absorption. the amount of insulin you need for basal, carb ratios, isf, etc will change throughout your life. we will always have to make adjustments.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Make sure to dose 15 min before eating. Don\u2019t forget onions have significant carbs. Looks like you used 1:15 ish ratio initially- 60carb/4. Try giving all 6 units up front as 1:10. You need more insulin up front to stop the rise. It might take more than that even. Keep in mind carb ratios can be different at different time of day.<br><br>\n"}

Occasionally we recognize the insulin resistance before we see the underlying illness.  Ultimately it means testing and correcting more often.  Cutting carbs a little bit.

If you can\u2019t keep anything down and are just super dehydrated, going to the er is the best bet.

In high school before I got diagnosed, I ran on the schools cross country team and before I started to get all the diabetes symptoms, I felt really good health wise. After my diagnosis, I had to quit running because my parents weren't confident I could manage the frequent lows and they didn't trust the school to help manage them either. It's been 4 years and I've gained a pretty significant amount of weight, (50lbs) and I'm trying to get back into running again like I used to. I've tried getting back into it before and it's not so much that it's physically difficult to run, it's just my blood sugar always seems to kick my ass regardless of how little I dose or even if I don't dose at all. The past 2 weeks I've started pretty small and I've been running just a mile every other day. When I wake up in the morning my blood sugar is normally anywhere from 200-230 before I correct. But when I'm about to go run, I don't correct it and ot still drops like crazy. Before my run today i was at 225, and when i finished I was at 87 and dropping. Right now it's not a huge problem because I'm close to home and there's people at home on standby if i need help, but I don't want to have to run with my brother driving alongside me forever, it's kind of embarrassing lol.

Is that something doable?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> As soon as I got diagnosed (like 4-5 weeks ago), I started running about 1.5-2 miles maybe 3x a week. If you have a cgm, just make sure you're checking every once in a while while you run. I stay strapped with a fanny pack, and I keep some gummies and emergency glucagon inside. You could even keep an apple juice in there if you wanted to be extra cautious. Maybe I'm just optimistic bc I'm a newbie but anything is possible if you take the right precautions.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> You will figure out what works for you, but as an Iron Man triathlete, I find 15 g of carbohydrates every 45 minutes of effort and a fairly low basal rate on the pump is the way to go. I like Honey stinger products like the waffles since they generally have half rapid absorption carbohydrates and some slower carbs.  You need to jog or cycle with water and have an empty pocket for the trash. You can also use gel or goo though they can be sticky. One of my favorites is gel blocks since they don\u2019t make a mess and you do not have to chase them with water. I do not recommend suspending or disconnecting from the pump as you will have pretty severe muscle cell starvation and cramping. Keep the basal rate going and figure out what your carb intake volume and frequency should be given how strenuous your effort.  Unless you were doing a high intensity workout, try my formula. A continuous glucose monitoring system and insulin pump will make this possible.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Inexperienced distance runner here - been just over a year - but the trick for me is just to always have food on me unless I\u2019m doing loops around the house. 4 mile trail run? Yep bringing a vest with expected snacks and extras. 20 mile adventure day? Same thing just more food and plenty of extra I\u2019m not expecting to touch. My main jam is fruit snacks, fruit bars, and then clif bars for longer days. Slow drip of calories works for me so far.<br><br>\n"}
{"id": "lnw57g", "text": "<div class='post' style='user-select:none;'>\n  <h2>Post</h2>\n  <p>How to deal with medical supply waste?\nHey y'all, this is my first time posting on reddit, so bear with me\n\nI'm a high school senior who has been diagnosed with type 1 for almost 6 years now. Even when I was first diagnosed, the sheer amount of plastic waste that comes with it was appalling, but as new technologies and treatments develop, it seems like there is even more waste than before in the packaging alone. One of the classes I am taking right now is Environmental Science, and I feel like crap whenever we discuss plastic use, even though my teacher makes it a point to let us know the main problem is big companies and not as much personal use as we think. He has be encouraging my class and I to reduce our use of plastic, but there is no way to really reduce how often I have to use plastic to Not Die\u2122 (that I can think of at least).\n\nMy family doesn't recycle, which... ouch. I try and save my recyclables and bring them to school as I help run the recycling program at my school, but I don't feel comfortable throwing in things associated with medical supply waste in with things like water bottles. Obviously syringes and other bio-waste things stay in a BD Sharps container, but the packaging for my pump and cgm supplies is overwhelming and I don't know exactly what to do with them so that they don't negatively impact the environment as much, especially since I have to use a lot of single-use plastic almost every 3 days and it starts to add up fast.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on reducing the use of or recycling the plastic that all of my diabetes supplies come in?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Here is what I have to say... I am t1d 42 yes and pumper.  I completely and totally understand your disgust and admire your passion.  I wish that we could reduce the waste but short of reusing lancets there isn\u2019t much we are able to do, especially since many of our disposables aren\u2019t even recyclable!  But here\u2019s the two main things 1.  This is life saving and necessary.  So please don\u2019t feel guilty, you are doing what you can! 2.  The systemic changes that need to occur have so much less to do with what a few million of us do to stay alive and so much more to do with industry at large.  So here\u2019s my suggestion, continue what you are doing.  In college maybe look into engineering (medical) or environmental sciences and impact the world that way.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Its completely grim how much waste there is with so many of our products. The huge cardboard boxes with supplies in more cardboard boxes. The hundreds of thousands of test strips we use or the plastic cannula cover thingies, or insertion devices for cgms.\n\nHonestly I just recycle the cardboard, everything else e.g my old cannula/reservoir etc can only go in the bin, similarly my needles will go to clinical waste.\n\nI think many companies, not just diabetic supply providers can do millions of times better, issue is theres no incentive. Its not like retail where you choose to buy sustainable clothes and vote with your money.. since asfaik no supplier in the diabetic realm is sustainable, nor cares to be. Its all about the \u00a3\u00a3.\n\noh: edit to say my family used to be the same about recycling so I feel your pain. Luckily our council issued recycling bins to every household so now I can do it at home. Idk if you have neighbours that have recycling bins which you could ask to use?<br><br>\n"}

If you have enough insulin resistance to justify a glp-1, even if its primary use I\u2019d for weight loss, this is the way to go. \n\nAs coverage of many things (devices) has expanded to include anyone who uses insulin, the \u201crisks\u201d of doing this and being mis-coded according to your insurance are negligible IMO.<br><br>\n"}

I would always let myself have things while getting crazy amounts of insulin (20-35 units) \nIn june, i got a dexcom g7 cgm and seeing the numbers so high scared me over time, (fyi i only got checked about once a day before my cgm, and sometimes even less) making me want to take control. my endo has been doing his best to help me get my life right and three months ago my A1c dropped two points making it a 10.0. This made me even more desperate for change, so I made the choice to cut down on carbs and monitor my blood sugar more efficiently. I have done a good job keeping my blood sugar under 200 and stay in my usual 90-180 range. And it\u2019s mostly because now i\u2019m scared of my sugar going high. \nI\u2019ve cut back tremendously on insulin now only getting about 3-8 units per meals and corrections (again, i used to get 20-35) i\u2019ve done this all because of my dexcom, it helped me wanna change and i\u2019m incredibly grateful for it. Now my question is, can this change in insulin and change in my blood sugar readings have risks? it was a very sudden change, i just decided to do it. i\u2019ve talked to my endo about this, showing him my dexcom 30 day glucose is  at 180 and a GMI estimate of 7.7, and now i look forward to my doctors appointment next month hoping for good news about my A1c. I hope i didn\u2019t over share, i just would love to know if i\u2019m at a possible risk of anything because of the sudden change. thank you!</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> I will say that it can make you feel really shitty until your body gets used to being that low.

And then once I get used to those, 250 and up feels like I\u2019m living in molasses, everything foggy. \n\nBut as far as risks for the abrupt changes, I haven\u2019t heard of any.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Rapid change in blood glucose can be tough on blood vessels in your eyes, but from reading your post this has been over 6 months rather than a couple of weeks and long term you are definitely doing the right thing for your health<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Like someone said, if you\u2019ve been high BG for a while, it may feel weird to be in normal range. But, your body adapts.\nTalk with endo about glucose to insulin range and build a plan for short term and long term insulin doses. I would advise against cutting back unless you talk with the endo and/or your overall carb count has dropped a lot. \nOr better yet, see if a connected pump might be ideal. Based on your intake (you do count) as well as readings, the pump will dose appropriately. \nAnother thing to add is drinking water. Our little capillaries in kidneys, eyes and feet/toes don\u2019t like a lot of sugar. I treat it like molasses passing through a stir straw. I also look at water as diluting and it will help take the pressure off of those systems.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Congratulations. It doesn\u2019t seem to sudden to me.<br><br>\n"}
{"id": "a1xuf5", "text": "<div class='post' style='user-select:none;'>\n  <h2>Post</h2>\n  <p>How should I prepare for jiu jitsu?\nJiu jitsu is a mix of long strenuous exercise and fast movements, I'm not quite sure what I'm doing wrong but I'm always high after a jiu jitsu session and not sure if im preparing correctly. The session is early in the morning so I have breakfast as normal and inject the correct amount, then I get ready, have another exchange of carbohydrates then start. Afterwards I check my glucose and it's too high, I don't know what im doing wrong</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> So after consuming carbohydrates your blood glucose increases then (in an optimal case) insulin eventually returns it to a normal level. If you start to exercise with a high BG level, however, instead of lowering, your level will go even higher. So this is just an assumption and I could very well be wrong about that, but could it be the case that you always start jiu jitsu during the period in which your BG level is increasing due to the carbohydrates you consumed and exercise further raises it?\n\nAlso, this might easily be a result of the dawn phenomenon, but if it only happens on those mornings you have jitsu then I doubt that hypo is the culprit.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> It could be theDawn Phenomenon? Our bodies are always changing. Here is the link if you wanna read up on it http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/treatment-and-care/blood-glucose-control/dawn-phenomenon.html\n\nIt also could be you ate a fatty meal the night before which is causing a slow rise in blood sugar through the night and into the morning. \n\nAnother reason could be just the sport itself. I'm sure you get your heart pumping pretty good in there. Not in an exercise way, rather more in a \"OH sh*t\" way, or a \"I'm gonna get this guy\".  when you are calculating your plan of attack and your opponent does something that catches you off guard and your heart starts racing. Kinda that adrenaline feeling. I'm sure you know what I'm talking about. When your body does that. It releases hormones for your fight or flight response which as a form of stress. And I know every diabetic knows what stress does to their blood sugar. This is a guess I'm not sure the type of athlete you are but it's a possibility. Maybe taking a low extra does of insulin before practice could help out with that. \n\nI just know from experience when I used to wrestle, I kinda would have a similar problem. So the \"stress\" thing kinda made since because I'm quite meticulous with my diabetes. Anyways just a thought. I hope it helps! <br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Shows how diabetes affects everyone differently. When I do jiu jitsu, my blood sugar plummets, especially during a strenuous bout. I try to go to the gym with minimal insulin on board, but I definitely get sporadic results. I\u2019ve also struggled with having me sensors get ripped off, so bjj has become one of those activities that I\u2019ve really struggled with since I was diagnosed.<br><br>\n"}

I have changed to low carb diet and now fasting numbers per glucometer are within normal range from diet. I want to get more tests to see if I am truly prediabetic or not if that is possible..

Fasting levels of insulin were high normal, but got high at 1hour and even higher at 2hours. More insulin produced as glucose wasn't reduced as quickly as it should be due to insulin resistance.  A1C, fasting and other glucose levels were normal or slightly high. This indicated IR rather than any other issue. \n\nThere's a table somewhere on the internet showing what the different combinations of high/normal a1c, fasting, glucose levels indicate.

I ate a Ezekiel English muffin (30 carbs) with 2 tablespoons of peanut butter. Took 6 units for my 1/10 ratio for my fast acting and that accounting for 1 shot of correction and  1 shot for my coffee with half and half. I go grocery shopping and i just shoot up to 280. Now I see on here people go higher than that but how much do I have to be concerned about that high number? I finished up real quick and rushed home to give me some more insulin and drink a lot of water to help bring it down. It\u2019s been going down real slow and it\u2019s finally under 200 pointed down a little more than an hour after I took my humulog. Now I know to bring my insulin everywhere I go for that reason. But for the future do I need to really concerned about it going to 280? I ask because I don\u2019t want to go into DKA again. For more info I am a newer type 1 diagnosed at age 30 in august 2020. Maybe I should stop drinking coffee  because for some reason caffeine in tea seems to react better than coffee caffeine</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Well, that's not a number that you want to be at, definitely not often. It happens to the best of us though, so don't be too hard on yourself. And yes, carry your insulin with you next time. \n\nDo you prebolus (administer bolus at least 15 minutes before eating)? That may help a lot. And yeah, it seems that coffee can spike blood sugar, even if it's black (no sugar/cream/milk).<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> You have absolutely nothing to worry about. It taught you a great lesson, too - always have insulin on you. \n\nI also wouldn't stop drinking coffee (assuming its something you enjoy), you could for a little while but I promise you'll figure out how it works in your body. It might take a while, especially because you've been diagnosed so recently, but through experience and trial and error, you'll figure out how to correct for all types of food.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I think a short spike that you quickly correct is nothing to be too worried about.  From what I understand serious diabetic damage comes from prolonged periods of high BG.<br><br>\n"}

It may not be as much a matter of making them feel better as a matter of making you feel better, because when we are experiencing highs and lows, our emotional reactions often make zero sense. So if you have access and understanding that there is a higher low going on, you can try )though it\u2019s not easy) and understand that their behavior whether it\u2019s acting short, tempered or \u201cdrunk\u201d (lows) or whatever is a product of biology and not a choice.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Calm walks have a tendency to help with high blood sugars, though need to be careful to not drop low (which exercise sometimes causes).

It\u2019s absolutely vital. If your sugars are high, your body draws all the water it can to flush excess glucose out where possible. You need to keep really topped up with water as dehydration can affect mood too. \nAlso meditation and mindfulness, if you really actually try a good few times and practice/stick at it, you\u2019ll find it helps you develop control and management over unwanted thoughts and emotions. \nYour emotions are a tool, but many people have not yet learned how to confine the use to their advantage and instead their lives are ruled by emotion.<br><br>\n"}

I didn't enjoy it at all, as we were never allowed to go out and do any of the fun \"camp activities\" you'd think of, like exploring the woods, building campfires, or learning skills created stuff with wood. It very much felt like it was a glorified summer babysitting service for parents of diabetics, as we just stayed inside, did activities inside, and didn't do all that much that we couldn't have done inside the city.\n\nBut also, around that point I was finally starting to feel confident enough to try putting in my pump infusion sites myself. I figured since I was away from my parents who normally inserted it, this would be an ideal time to do it myself. However instead, the local nurse/medic/health aide made it absolutely 100% clear that I was *not allowed* to insert it myself for any reason, and if I needed a change, I *must* go and have her do it for me.\n\nSure maybe it had valid reasons, like they didn't want to risk any parent suing the camp because their kid hurt themselves trying to put a site in.
