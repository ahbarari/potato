More info/ background in comments</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> So I've just got a letter from my diabetic specialist with my diagnosis on and those details on above and he's advised that I'm type 2 diabetic. Now a little background (also not a massive fan of this doctor as he told me he 'doesn't believe in type 3c diabetes' \n\n- March 2022 was hospitalised with pancreatis and necrotising pancreas. On arrival to the ward they took my blood for a HbA1c and it came back as 38. \n\n- In hospital for 3 months at 2 different hospitals. In those hospitals both diabetic teams told me I'm type 3c but to treat myself/ follow advice for type 1 as this is closer and there's not a lot of stuff online for type 3c's. \n\n- While in hospital I couldn't eat so was put on a feeding tube. This was super high in sugar to where I was on 70 units a day and my HbA1c in July was 97 \n\n- I know my HbA1c isn't great now but it's come down and I'm still struggling with my diagnosis/ life but I'm trying. \n\nI'm just struggling to understand why hrs said I'm type 2 from the information I have and know. Like if I wasn't diabetic before then my pancreas dies and now I am surely I'm pancreatic? I was also advised multiple times that I will be diabetic for life now and insulin dependant?<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> I'm no expert but here's my understanding of your tests.  \n\nNone of the  tests you've shown suggest you **are** type 2, rather they suggest you're **not** type 1.\n\nSo, the logical conclusion would be you have type 2 as that's extremely common,  but as you say you have 3c.\n\nYour A1c is high so you defo have diabetes. \n\nPresence of Anti GAD, transporter 8 or IA2 are possible indicators of type 1. \n\nYou don't have these which indicates you possibly don't have type 1. \n\nYour C peptide numbers are in normal range ( i think) which suggests you have normal beta cell function... which means you don't have type 1.\n\nI guess you will need blood work that suggests you're not type 2 to convince your doc 3c exists.  I don't know which tests though, as I'm not yet clued in enough about t2. Maybe something to do with your triglyceride levels.<br><br>\n"}

My nana on my mother\u2019s side at the age of 35. Here\u2019s the thing, I am 22 years old and I\u2019ve just been diagnosed with celiac disease. I found out online that T1D is much more prevalent in people with celiac. I was already worried I will develop it one day, but now I\u2019m extra worried. Since I have several risk factors, does anyone know just how likely it is that I will develop T1D? I found the risk factors for development with celiac disease & for having a parent with T1D, but nothing about both together. Pls let me know if I\u2019m posting in the wrong sub for this. I hope you\u2019re all doing well!!! :)</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Google trialnet. Depending on your age you are eligible for free risk screening.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> I wouldn't overly worry about it. It might happen and it might not. My advice is to get a glucose reader and do a quick test every so often, especially if you get any of the symptoms<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> If your father has T1 then you have a 1 in 17 chance of getting it.\n\nhttps://www.diabetes.org/diabetes/genetics-diabetes\n\nI don't know the statistics regarding celiac, but I think you might be misunderstanding this fact a bit. I don't think there's anything special about celiac as it relates to T1. Having ANY autoimmune disease makes you much more likely than the average person to have a second autoimmune disease. So that probably does make your odds somewhat worse than 1 in 17, but I couldn't say how much worse.\n\nStill though I wouldn't worry about it as there's nothing you can do to prevent it anyway - it will either happen or it won't. You can get tested if you like to see if you carry the gene that increases your risk of developing it. Otherwise all you can do is be aware of the symptoms and check yourself periodically so it can at least be caught early if it does happen.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> The age that your family members developed diabetes is quite late, and points to Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA), which occurs most often in ppl over the age of 30.  It is not typical T1D, as it progresses at a much slower rate, even though the end treatment is the same (insulin reliance).  You can do some research on LADA, and there are antibody tests that are used to confirm its diagnosis, but I\u2019m not sure if the tests can be used to predict your likelihood of developing it.  Some ppl on this sub have rather strong opinions about LADA vs T1D, so they may offer more info about it.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> My dad got it at 28.  His sister got it late 30s.  I got it at 46.  My siblings in their mid 40s don't have it.  I never knew I had a 1/17 chance.  I never worried about it.  I figured if it was coming it was coming and there wasn't a lot I could do about.  I lost the dice roll on it.  I'm dealing with it.  Do the TrialNet testing if it's something you can deal with.<br><br>\n"}

{"id": "tt9kjd", "text": "<div class='post' style='user-select:none;'>\n  <h2>Post</h2>\n  <p>How I Compiled A Perpetual Backup Cooling Plan For My Insulin Stash For Under $1,000\nEdit: if it\u2019s not clear from the post\u2026.I\u2019m talking about my two years worth of backup insulin, not my day to day stuff.\n\nThis came up in the comment section and after answering that, I thought I\u2019d make it a post. I compiled this after lots of research for my own peach of mind regarding a power outage.\n\nI\u2019m not a prepper by any means, but a power outage is my realistic worst case scenario for my insulin.\n\nIn the unlikely event of SHTF, camping, or roadtrips, this is also nice peace of mind.\n \nWhat I\u2019m going into here will be a wall of text and isn\u2019t exactly what you have to do, just putting my own conclusions up from my hours of research.\n\nMy personal budget was about $1,000 but I didn\u2019t accumulate everything at once, and this can be modified.\n\n1.\t\u2060POWER STATION - A power station is just awesome in general to have. Think like a battery pack you might carry for your phone, but with dramatically more capacity. They will come with regular outlets on-the-go which is convenient and usually include lots of USB ports for smaller things like phones/tablets/laptops. In my instance, my rabbit hole started because I wanted to find a way to backup cool my insulin if I ever lost power.\n\nThings I looked for in a power station (and you should too)\n\n\u2022\t\u2060LifeP04 (lithium iron phosphate) batteries and NOT standard lithium ion batteries we\u2019re used to in everyday life. LifeP04 batteries have two awesome benefits over lithium ion: 1) they can be recharged about 2500 times before losing capacity unlike lithium ion\u2019s which are usually cooked after about 500 [think like your cell phone that doesn\u2019t hold a charge as well as it did two years ago]. And 2) LifeP04 batteries are much more stable than lithium ion batteries in heat. If\u2019 I\u2019m ever moving around in my car and the summer sun has my trunk over 100 degrees, I have peace of mind knowing I don\u2019t have to worry about fire hazard.\n\u2022\t\u2060\n\n\nMINIMUM 500Wh CAPACITY: One thing you find is that a lot of random appliances require a shocking amount of energy. To have a viable option for a battery pack that won\u2019t be out of juice instantly, make sure it is appropriately sized.\n\u2022\t\u2060\n\n\nSOLAR CAPABILITY: Did you know you can buy nifty portable, light, solar panels that can charge your battery pack if it has the ability? This was really important to me because if we lost power, I wanted a way to produce enough energy that I could power a small fridge indefinitely off the sun for my peace of mind.\n\nPASS THROUGH CHARGING: Not all of these power stations can let you use your wall plugs while you are charging the station itself. If you buy a station with pass through charging, you can simultaneously charge the power station from your solar panels, while leaving your compressor fridge plugged in and running.\n\n\n\n2) COMPRESSOR FRIDGE - Did you know even a standard mini fridge can usually kill a big 500Wh power pack in a couple hours? That doesn\u2019t work for me if I need an insultin solution, so I looked into compressor fridges.\n\nThese are usually around the size of a cooler, but they have compressors that can keep them actively chilled. They plug in with a 12V car charger and only pull about 10W to run. This means, if I have a 500Wh battery pack, it can hold enough juice to keep my fridge running a couple days when without charging.\n\nEven if my battery packs can\u2019t recharge with my solar option (night/rain/cloudy), I can still plug the fridge into my car\u2019s 12v circle charger. HOW COOL IS THAT? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nSo here are some links of what I bought. You don\u2019t have to buy exactly what I did, but I\u2019ve been quite happy with my setup and am happy to vouch for it.\n\nIf anything, I hope this lights the urge in you to do your own exploring and see if you learn more.\n\nI cannot recommend JASONOID on YouTube enough as a cool resource for all this.\n\nBLUETTI EB55 (These sometimes go on sale) I caught mine on amazon for $399 https://www.amazon.com/BLUETTI-Portable-Generator-Regulated-Emergency/dp/B098LSKJHH\n\nSetpower 45L (used to be about $300.

I've backpacked for weeks before in tropical climates using only small Frio packs to store insulin, often without a fridge, and it did just fine but I fully understand that's not always the case.\n\nCool(heh) to prepare yourself. \u2744<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I\u2019ve been leaving insulin in a hot car during Florida summers for a decade but that\u2019s a neat idea.\n\nMore important thing in my opinion is to have a large enough stash of insulin to sustain yourself for a long time.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> I gotta admit I\u2019m impressed. I came here for ideas. You\u2019ve given me a few. Thanks.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Great advise<br><br>\n"}

I\u2019ve had extensive laser, injections and vitrectomy in both eyes and I\u2019ve noticed a cloud kinda forming in my irises. I see my othamogist  regularly and he hasn\u2019t made a comment about anything? I have regular scans, pressure taken, dilation. I\u2019ve just started to notice I get blurriness that comes and goes and I thought it was just dry eyes but I\u2019ve noticed in photos the weird looking film.\n\nI\u2019m freaked out, just looking for some guidance and personal experiences</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Not had a virectomy yet but due one. Have been told by eye surgeon that cataracts are inevitable. Partly why it has been put back.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> I have moderate retinopathy. I got cataract surgery at 35yo as a result of laser and high sugars putting them into overdrive. My opthamologist couldn\u2019t get a good view of my retina it was so cloudy, which is why I went ahead with it. \n\nI got to say, it was a good things for me. I went from -6.75 with HORRIBLE night vision and worsening colour vision (as a graphic artist this was an issue), to 20/20 vision with colours being bright again and nighttime vision restored. I need a light correction for small type (I wear readers while working) but am glasses free. The hardest part was being careful for the 4 months while things healed (no lifting over 10lb or leaning over for 2 months, then repeat for the other eye). I am very happy I had it done so young. \n\nI haven\u2019t had a vitrectomy. But I get eye shots ever 6-8 weeks in each eye still.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I was born with cataracts from an injection my mother got when she was pregnant with me. Doctor verified them when I was 9 at my 1st eye exam. Diagnosed w T1D when I was 12, back in 1975 before glucose monitors were invented. Cataracts didn\u2019t impair my vision until I was 35, so had left eye done first, only to learn I am allergic to the most common  eye anesthesia. Had an asshole of a surgeon who didn\u2019t believe me when I called after hours in severe pain & told me to \u201cbuck up and drink a beer\u201d. Was scheduled to have other eye done the next week, but refused to see same Dr, so waited 10 years & went down to U of M Kellogg Eye Center, where they used lidocaine instead of Preparacaine in my eye. Went great that time. Now I have better eyesight than I did when I was 9 years old!  Since I was young when I had the 1st one done, they used a multifocal  lens in my eye so I could see both distance & up close. When you have them done at older ages they don\u2019t use a multifocal lens unless you pay extra for them and you have to wear readers. I have only had a small bleed on my left retina after 49 years of T1D & only had laser treatments on that eye, so haven\u2019t had to have a Vitrectomy, so I don\u2019t know if that causes cataracts. If you aren\u2019t allergic to the anesthesia the surgery for cataracts is easy and so beneficial!!<br><br>\n"}
{"id": "10hslar", "text": "<div class='post' style='user-select:none;'>\n  <h2>Post</h2>\n  <p>How to Calculate Insulin Dosage?\nHi,\n\nAs the title says I\u2019m trying to understand How should I calculate my insulin dosage based on my carb in take. I\u2019m trying to understand this because from what I read on the internet calculating my insulin in take purely based on the carb amount I take is not correct and there are other things to include. Like fiber, protein etc.\n\nI\u2019m 28 y old and I have diabetes for 26 years. Previously I didn\u2019t need to count carbs because my life was very stabile. But now I\u2018m more active, like going to gym, eating outside with friends, work etc. So my eating habits and my life style changed a lot. So I\u2018m now more curious because for example this morning around 10-11 AM my glucose levels were around 120+ and I ate 2 slices of bread which each slice contains 26g carbs, a mix of eggs, tomato, onion and paprika food, some cheese, olive and butter. I took 4 units before and 2 units an hour later. Logically it should have been enough but after 3 hours my glucose levels were around 300 and I took 2 more units and it still going up.\n\nSo in general I am very confused and I want to understand better how should I calculate detailly my insulin need and what to consider or if there are any apps that would help me calculate insulin need better I would like to learn them. Like for example an app considers everything like protein, fiber and tells me this is how much I need or if someone here could tell me or provide me a source it would be great.\n\nThanks.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Waltzing the dragon has a formula for calculating fat and protein and the juicebox podcast has an episode on it. There is also an app called insulin calculator black square with blue circle that calculates for f&p. I havent compared it to doing the formula myself though. Experiment with your carb ratios as well.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> The entire 11 years I\u2019ve had type one Ive had an endocrinologist/diabetes specialist work out my ratios. I know there are ways of working it out yourself but my personal opinion is to trust a professional. Then again, I am in the UK and get my healthcare free and I know that\u2019s not the same for everyone. Just make sure that, if you have to work it out yourself, you do it safely and start small so you don\u2019t give yourself too much insulin. Take care of yourself!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I know this is not what you asked (sorry!), but how long do you take your insulin before you eat? I use novarapid and find taking it about 10 - 15 mins before most meals helps stop the spike in the first place. I think the time varies from person to person though and also the exact meal (like I know high fat slows down my digestion a lot).\n\nHaving said that, I know newer insulins such as fiasp start working more quickly and so you don't have to take them so far in advanced.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> learn about the glycemic index. sometimes you have to split up the dose throughout the duration of the meal absorption. the amount of insulin you need for basal, carb ratios, isf, etc will change throughout your life. we will always have to make adjustments.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Make sure to dose 15 min before eating. Don\u2019t forget onions have significant carbs. Looks like you used 1:15 ish ratio initially- 60carb/4. Try giving all 6 units up front as 1:10. You need more insulin up front to stop the rise. It might take more than that even. Keep in mind carb ratios can be different at different time of day.<br><br>\n"}
