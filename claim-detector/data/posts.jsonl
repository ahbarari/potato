{"id": "ch7kb8", "text": "<div class='post' style='user-select:none;'>\n  <h2>Post</h2>\n  <p>Can't seem to get my Blood Sugars down the last few days.\nMy A1C is typically around 7.0 so I feel I have good control of my sugars. However, this last week has been a struggle for some reason. It seems like not matter what I do I can't get it to stay below 200. I exercise, eat pretty well(no fast food and watch the carbs), don't really drink, and don't smoke but having a hard time getting it down. \n\nExample: Sugar is 138 about to eat so I take Humalog. Made a sandwich, portioned out some chips, and had unsweet tea. 3 hours later my sugar is 240 and my CGM says it's trending upwards. Take 10units only to find it does nothing.  Dinner time comes and I'm still around 230. I take my normal 20units but don't eat and watch my monitor. 2 hrs later sugar is only 220. Go to bed after taking my Lantus, wake up and my sugar is 240. Ugggggghhhh. Take 20 units and 2 hrs later it's still 220. Take 10 more units and 2 hrs later it's up 240 and I haven't eaten and just had water to drink.\n\nBeen like this all week. Any ideas?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Hard to know for sure. Some common causes are:\n 1. hormones from, say, stress, menstruation, or pregnancy\n  2. infection\n  3. intermittent beta cell activity in honeymoon<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Are you on a pump? Try a new site. Or try to correct with an injection, first, to see if that\u2019s it. \n\nIs your insulin off? Try a new bottle. \n\nAre your basal rates on point?<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Basal is spot on and I tried a new bottle of insulin. I don't use the pump, I use Humalog and a syringe. Going to try a new spot. Always forget about that.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Could be an infection or a number of other reasons.  I saw that you mentioned that you will try a new injection site - Rotating sites is important .  But, just to be on safe side , call your physician or diabetes go-to -professional to be sure something else is not going on.  Good luck.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Well, it seems like switching injection sites did the trick. Moved from my arms to injecting in my thighs and for the last 24hrs my sugar has averaged 160. \n\nThanks for the advice. It's funny how something so small can make such a difference. Stupid ass diabetes.<br><br>\n"}
{"id": "ecaq6l", "text": "<div class='post' style='user-select:none;'>\n  <h2>Post</h2>\n  <p>How do you gain weight with type 1 diabetes?\nHi - My boyfriend has type 1 diabetes and he wants to gain weight. He is very tall but can't seem to achieve a healthy weight for his height. I am the household chef so I thought it made sense that I asked what foods, meals etc could aid him in his journey to gain weight.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Not to assume anything, but make sure blood sugar is in check first. It\u2019ll be impossible to gain weight if you\u2019re high all the time. \n\nApart from that it\u2019s really just high fat and high carb foods. Not necessarily bad fats. Plain Greek yogurt/low fat milk/dark chocolate are all a part of my diet and help me keep good weight. Avocados, bananas, pasta, potatoes come to mind as well.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Never thought I'd see a question like this! I am really having trouble losing weight, I don't have to do anything to gain weight.. (insulin promotes fat creation)<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I used to eat a cup of shelled sunflower seeds a day when I was bodybuilding.  It\u2019s relatively low carb if I remember correctly and 1 cup of shelled seeds provides around 700 calories.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Carbs, mostly, over high fats. But again with the first reply you can't gain weight with high blood sugars, the body cells starve and start eating themselves.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> I'm an old school T1D.  Been T1D for over 50 years.  I'm still using Novolin N and R twice a day.  When I want to lose weight, I cut back on my Novolin R before dinner and do a postprandial walk of 3-5 miles to burn off the calories.  To gain weight I increase the Novolin R to be able to consume more calories.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> I've found it's easier to gain muscle over fat with type 1, but to just look healthier and a bit more \"filled out,\" just work hard to keep your numbers in check, eat reasonable carbs that are easy to process/calculate how much insulin to dose, and eat a ton of protein and fat. Keeping your numbers lower is the most important part about keeping weight on though.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> High fat, high carb diet. Basically lots of insulin will fatten you up, be careful of your sugar levels though.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> How old is he?  I graduated high school at 6'3\" and 168 pounds.  Grew another inch and grew shoulders in college and graduated college at 6'4\" and 185.  Around 27 y.o. my metabolism finally started to slow down and finally cracked 200.  At 40 I actually had to start watching what I ate as I was up to 220 and with 4 kids, no time to exercise and cleaning up what they didnt eat.  I played sports in college and they had me on 6000 calorie diets to gain weight for over a year.  Might just be metabolism.  Have him track calories and then bring that in to his next appointment with his endocrinologist to discuss.  I really would not mess with insulin to gain weight, unless Dr. Is ok with that.  Skinny sucks, overweight sucks, but doing irreversible damage because of playing games with insulin, not my recommendation.   Good luck.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 9:</b> Hit the gym, use alot of weights, take LOTS of protein (with foods, protein shakes, anything really).<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 10:</b> I have the same issue. It would be nice to gain weight...\n\nHigh blood sugars will make you drop weight. Carbs will help make you gain weight. I accepted a long time ago that it would be expensive and stressful to eat the carbs required to gain weight, like I was able to in the army, without being very dangerous to myself. Some body types, like mine, just don't gain weight as easily.\n\nWeight lifting can make a large impact in increasing your mass and weight, but will still require carbs.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 11:</b> How\u2019s his control? If he is high a lot he will always have trouble gaining weight.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 12:</b> Workout, protine shake helps even the ones with sugar as you'll burn it off when working out. I had similar issue was around 50 kilos now i m 75 5.11\" and gaining :D<br><br>\n"}

Differently take care of yourself.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Lowering your A1C too quickly *can* have negative effects on your body, especially your eyes. During my first pregnancy I lowered my A1C from 8.7 to 5.9 in a matter of a month or two and ended up with some hemorrhaging in my left eye. Thankfully it healed up and I\u2019m fine, but for sure other\u2019s it has caused more permanent problems. I\u2019d check with your doctors to be safe.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> To preface this: this might not be the best advice, but this is experiences I have had, and what I would do if I were you. Also I hope to calm some of your nerves.\n\nI went through a bad period of bad life circumstances, bad access to insulin, and depression. My bg was NOT good. \n\nRecently, I noticed periods of blurred vision and I developed spots in my vision. I had the same retinopathy fears. It was shocking because at every yearly exam I had healthy eyes. (Still do, yay!)\n\nI went to the doc and found out I have vitreous floaters. My doc said there is no prevention or treatment. She told me it can just happen with age (I'm in my mid 30s; only had type 1 since 2013), but to look out for other issues with my eyes. \n\nI don't want to say you don't have retinopathy.... I don't know your eyes. But I just want to calm fears that this might have some other explanation. Like you said, it might just be a change in your vision.\n\nWith your insurance, if they quoted 5-6 wks. I would call the day after 5 wks and keep calling. There might be nothing they can do, but there might be something they can do. Or at least give you some timeline or information.\n\nAs far as scheduling, I've had people on reddit say I should schedule an urgent appointment. When I scheduled and told them about my issue, they were kinda nonchalant, \"oh ok\" about it lol. Depending on your insurance, call more then one doc and find an appointment as soon as possible. If you feel like you need to. Obviously your choice.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> I\u2019m 18 diagnosed at the age of 4, the whole eye stuff definitely scares me. I hope everything works out for you<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> The potential increase in eye issues when lowering a1c is temporary- and keeping the a1c steady and low (close to normal) will keep them healthy. Follow up with your eye doc when you can! (If you\u2019re nervous you could try a slower descent to normal instead of so abrupt?)<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> I have retinopathy and it sucks. I\u2019m a fragile/brittle diabetic. Was diagnosed at age 7, and I\u2019m 36 now. I had a1c\u2019s that went up and down my sugars vary between 100-300 real quick. But you need to be hella careful because diabetes is a real bitch. It can be nothing, could just be floaters. But please get in touch with the new insurance like right after the five week mark. Your eyes are not something to play around with.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> They may just be floaters. General rule is if they move around they are harmless.  You don't necessarily have to have crazy high blood sugar levels to develop retinopathy.  It increases the likelihood but is not the only cause.  Definitely take your progress to lower blood sugars slowly. If you develop a solid unmoving shape or notice  dimming or foggy vision please treat it as an emergency.  I am not a doctor and I am not trying to diagnose you.  I have had retinopathy so I understand your fears. I hope you get the insurance sorted soon and chase them up if there are delays.  Wishing you the very best.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> Yes, I was blind for months after I got home from initial diagnosis, guess it dropped to fast and \u201cflooded\u201d my lenses. Everything looked like I was under water. Finally reading glasses helped and it eventually went nearly back to normal. At least til the astigmatism kicked in, oh the migraines! Anyway, it\u2019ll be worth getting an eye check when you can. <3<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 9:</b> Get them checked ASAP. I'm currently waiting for a Vitrectomy which by all accounts is pretty savage, however the first port of call was laser surgery. This was pretty unpleasant, but definitely worth doing asap<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 10:</b> I could \"see\" that (duh dum, tssssh)\n\nAt your age, astigmatisms are normal for anyone with or without diabetes.  What will happen later in life though is that your blood vessels in your eyes, which are very very tiny, will clob and burst causing blindness.  Take care of your self.  Then no need to worry.<br><br>\n"}

Any tips to avoid?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> If you guys have a designated person usually they love doing all this medical stuff atleast my friends do hahaha. I usually tell them to give me 2 shots if my sugar is over 12 cause trying to stay tight never works.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Check your blood sugar as often as possible. \n\nHave something to correct a low. Have at least one friend around who knows how to recognize and treat a low or severe high.\n\nBe willing to run a little high if necessary. A drunk night at 180-200 is better than risking a devastating low.\n\nBut really staying aware of your readings is most important. Even if you barely remember the next day, a low or high reading is probably going to trigger your drunk mind to either eat or bolus/inject as necessary.\n\nETA: Also consider what you\u2019re drinking. Alcohol is different for everyone. For me beer raises my blood sugar, hard liquor has no impact (unless mixed with a sugary drink), and wine seems to lower my blood sugar.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> i personally avoid carby alcohol like beer and wine. if i go for cocktails, i dont give any insulin as the alcohol content will lower me while the sugar in the mixers will keep me higher.\nif mixing a spirit and diet mixer i make sure to keep snacking through the night (like small crisps or something)\n\nmake sure there's someone with you who knows how to look out for a hypo in you and keep checking sugars often.\n \ni went out the other day for cocktails but still had to suspend my basal a few hours later as the alcohol made me drop quite quick so watch out for that as well<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> My nurse told me that after a night out, I should eat junk food and not shoot insulin for it. Works for me, but I only got really drunk a few times after diagnosis. Covid etc.\n\nLiver burns sugar when getting rid of alcohol. And it's too busy with the alcohol to release sugar to compensate for a low.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> I know this will get downvoted because it\u2019s not what you want to hear, but you could try moderation. Just one or two drinks. \n\nYou could offer to be the designated driver! \n\nThat is the only sure way to drink safely as a person living with t1d. I learned that the hard way when I was in my 20\u2019s. It\u2019s been 20 years since I was drunk or high. I don\u2019t miss it. At all. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I still enjoy beer, wine, and the occasional high ball, but inebriation is just not an option. Gotta stay in control, you know? \n\nBe safe!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Eat before. Test lots. Make sure you have a snack before bed (this one is the most important). From my own experience, I bolus for the first two beers max, but then don\u2019t for any more. I usually stick with Gin and Soda as that keeps me stable, but after 5 I will start to trend down. Even if my sugars are on the higher side (8-9), I would have a peanut butter sandwich with no bolus before sleeping so that I don\u2019t go low. \n\nWatch out for lows the next day! I usually only need minimal basal if any. Which is nice, especially if you want hungover chinese food.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> Eat<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> Eat a solid meal beforehand. For me protien helps keep sugars up but not super high. 6 hours later is kind of a gamble.\n\nCheck your sugar as often as you can; the more you know the better. But in the end it's better to be high than low.\n\nHaving someone around who knows your T1D in case things go really wrong can be a good buffer. Like if you're getting really sloppy, they can check your BG and at least know you're drunk and not super low.\n\nParty On!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 9:</b> Never drink on an empty stomach<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 10:</b> 1. Eat before (something substantial)\n\n2. Check sugars every 45-60mins if you remember. Don\u2019t be to far away from quick acting carbs\n\n3. Have someone in the group know you have diabetes \n\n4. Have something to eat when you get home (best to make it before you go)\n\n5. Run sugars high overall for the night<br><br>\n"}

He had RLS problems prior to the hospital trip but seems like now we have his sugar in a manageable range his RLS is a thousand times worse.  Like he doesn't sleep,  he can't.  Fights his legs all night long.  Numerous medications thrown at him with no relief,  we have resorted to compression,  tens, and massage all for him to just suffer through it.  He gets maybe 1 night good rest a week.  He no longer takes any oral meds after deciding none of them help,  they make it worse.  I'm in desperate search of something to get him relief.

As a cell keeps breaking off phosphate groups from ATP for energy, ATP turns into ADP and then AMP (tri-phosphate -> di-phosphate -> mono-phosphate), and when AMP levels rise it sends a \u201clow energy\u201d signal, which among other things triggers AMPK to allow glucose into the cell without needing insulin. People with type 1 who do tons of sub-zone 2 exercise can get down to frankly ridiculous insulin requirements (like 10-12u TDD), because they\u2019re shuttling so much glucose into cells via this mechanism.\n\nAs to why, insulin resistance can have a variety of causes, and sometimes it\u2019s a transient thing (cortisol, high levels of fatty acids in the bloodstream after a meal, etc). If you\u2019ve already checked the main ones (weight, sleep, exercise, diet), the next step is mentioning it to your endo.\n\nUnder the \u201cno risk\u201d bucket of things to try, there\u2019s lots of anecdotal (and some clinical) evidence pointing to copper, selenium, and magnesium supplements improving insulin sensitivity.<br><br>\n"}

Then, I\u2019d inject long acting insulin. This way, during summers where I was really active and swimming and sweating and in the sand, I could be detached from my pump, but not have to inject every time I wanted a snack / meal because I could just reconnect my pump to bolus quickly.

I bet if you google \u201cuntethered\u201d insulin pump things would come up.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Yes. Actually,  it's something alot of pregnant diabetics will do because once insulin resistant hits, pumps hardly last the 3 days they're supposed to with the crazy amount of insulin needed.  So,  the pump will take care of basal needs and the injections are for bolusing.<br><br>\n"}
{"id": "t7ico4", "text": "<div class='post' style='user-select:none;'>\n  <h2>Post</h2>\n  <p>Can you get hypoglycemia as a type 1 diabetic without the use of insulin?\nHi everyone. I have been trying to do a lot of research over the past few days because I suspect I have type 1 diabetes. However, one of my main issues I believe is hypoglycemia (chills in morning, heart racing when i wake up) and it seems though people are saying that too much insulin is usually the cause for it. As someone that has never used insulin once before, can this be possible? Or can I rule out type 1 diabetes as a possible condition.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> If you are undiagnosed diabetic, it is very unlikely you would experience hypoglycemia.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> If you don\u2019t mind me asking, how old are you? If you are a child/young adult with undiagnosed type 1 diabetes you would be in a permanent state of hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) rather than hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). \n\nSome non-diabetics are susceptible to low blood sugars but this is usually following intense exercise, not as a matter of routine such as waking up<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> There can be other reasons for experiencing hypoglycemia. Typically undiagnosed diabetics experience high blood sugars as the pancreas produces less insulin. \n\nThat being said, when I was in middle school (before diagnosis) I often experienced passing out and low blood sugars after extended periods of exercise. Doctors said this was unrelated to my diagnosis, but I suspect that it could have been a precursor to the disease. That was 4+ years before I was diagnosed with diabetes. \n\nA diabetes diagnosis will usually occur after high blood sugars. You would experience intense thirst, peeing a lot, sometimes nausea, extreme weight loss, and fatigue.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Doubt it. The main issue an undiagnosed type 1 diabetic has is usually high blood sugar/ hyperglycaemia.\n\nEdit I have done some googling. It seems that hypos are (to an extent) normal after intense exercise even for non-diabetics. \n\nBut if its at other times when you haven't been exercising it seems strange<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Have you checked your thyroid recently? I'm type 1 so not the best example for you but I experienced heart racing + chills when I started getting thyroid issues.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> For a year or so before one of my kids was diagnosed type 1, they had hypos every morning when they woke up. (Didn't know that's what it was at the time.) Shaking was the #1 thing we noticed. It is actually very common for people with Type 1 to experience hypos prior to diagnosis. In fact, the morning of the day she was diagnosed (with a BG of 450), her fasting BG was 39.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> Definitely consult your health care provider, if you do not have a specialist like an endocrinologist look into getting one. Sounds like you need lab work done. Your thyroid and adrenal glands can create adverse physical symptoms as well so it\u2019s best to be sure. Good luck!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> You can have low blood sugar prior to being dx with Type 1 diabetes. But more concerning than random lows would be signs of diabetes like extreme thirst, frequent urination, exhaustion, etc.<br><br>\n"}

I have never drank before but I would like to be able to drink with my friends. I understand that drinking can be very dangerous. I have a cgm and a pump and I am using the loop app to manage BG. I read that hard liquor can lower blood sugars, how does that work? Can I get around this by just lowering my basal and not worrying about it? How do I drink safely with T1D?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> (Assuming 16 is the legal drinking age in your country)\n\neat a meal before you start drinking, preferably with a glass of water. \n\nknow what a serving of alcohol is no matter the type of alcohol,\n\nno more than 1 serving of alcohol per hour,\n\nalways have a designated driver, I also make sure people know to call 911 if I can't be woken they are not allowed to use my insulin on me.\n\nI drink sugary mixed drinks because I find that drinking lowers my blood sugar enough that my sugary mixed drinks keep me up, but I have to keep something next to the bed, because I usually go low before I wake up the next day. The only way to know how alcohol affects you personally is to keep your CGM close at all times.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> When your liver is processing alcohol, it will stop releasing glucose. If you still have basal insulin running at the normal rate, than your blood sugar will drop. There are different strategies for handling this. Lowering your basal rate and/or having a closed loop system do it for you is helpful. Make sure to never drink on an empty stomach. Be mindful that some alcoholic drinks have a lot of sugar and you may not need to bolus as much as you would for a nonalcoholic version of that same drink. Basically, a lot of trial and error. Keep an eye on your blood sugar.  And drink plenty of water. Cheers!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> At your age: make sure your parents are OK with it. Seriously. Because if it goes wrong - and at some stage, it will - they need to know what's been going on and not be guessing. Trust me on this. It may have saved my life when I was 17 and stupid.\n\nHave food on board. Don't be alone. Try, if you can, to avoid drinking to excess. Experiment, slowly. I don't mean outrageous mixes, I mean:\n\n* 1 beer on its own, no insulin does: this.\n* 1 beer, 1 unit just as I drink it does: this.\n* 1 shot, on its own, no insulin, does: this\n\nAnd so on. It's a little hit or miss. But you'll build your own little library of alcohol affects you. There are generalizations of how alcohol affects T1s. They are generalizations, not universal truths. Hard liquor with no mixers doesn't affect me, nor does white wine. Beer does, and the hoppier/darker it is, the more it does. Insulin required, and no, it doesn't drop me afterwards.\n\nIf your parents are cool with it, do the experiment and note taking with them present; that might help them trust you a bit more. If they're not, find your most responsible trustworthy friend and do it with him. Have glucose and insulin nearby and make sure he or she knows the difference.\n\nAt some point you're going to fuck up. Practice your apology speech now.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> It\u2019s not that dangerous, you have a CGM. People here seem to forget diabetes and drinking has been around a hell of a lot longer than CGMs have. I highly disagree with bringing other people into the fold beyond \u201chey I\u2019m diabetic, if I ask for sugar bring me sugar\u201d but to each their own. \n\nDon\u2019t do straight liquor or hunch punch that some dude made for the party. No one that age can pace themselves and it goes off the rails very easily. Beer is awesome. \n\nDon\u2019t take insulin for any drinks you have. Have low sugar snacks on hand. \n\nIt\u2019s always better to be slightly high than it is to be super low while drinking. Give yourself a buffer. You can always take insulin if you\u2019re running high towards the end of the night. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to handle it, folks go way overboard with this, it\u2019s not that complicated. You don\u2019t need insulin for drinks unless you\u2019re smashing a bunch of sugary alcoholic drinks, which, don\u2019t do that. Jack and regular coke? Don\u2019t. Orange juice and vodka? Don\u2019t. Have low supplies and play it safe with a buffer. Easy.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> https://www.jdrf.org/t1d-resources/living-with-t1d/food-and-diet/diabetes-and-alcohol/<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> I don't personally drink, but I have been told that if I were to, to have a sober friend who is willing to keep an eye on me for the night, willing and able to wake me up if I were to have a hypo during the night<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> Please ignore the blanket advice of \"your body will do this\", \"your body will do that\". \n\nThere is ZERO guarantee that you will respond in the predictable manner.\n\nFor instance, I go high and stay high with alcohol, no matter the type. A shot of straight vodka has the same effect for me as a regular soda. But it lasts longer\n\nThe only safer way to drink is start slow, in the safety of your own home, with both high and low supplies and preferably either on your own or with a friend or two.\n\nThe more calm and alert you are to your diabetes while drinking, for the first time, the better. \n\nFinding out how you'll respond at a raging party is not a good idea. \n\nBut, testing the waters on your own can help you during those parties.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> Don't drink for the first time while out with freinds. Do it at home with your parents present until you learned how  your body handle alchohol and drinks of different sugar and carb levels.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 9:</b> When I first started drinking (and continuing drinking all night) I used to drink one alcoholic drink, and then a pint of water. I alternated between booze and water until I got older and more experienced with booze.\n\nI would definitely recommend this for anyone, for a number of reasons. 1. You\u2019ll fill up with liquid faster so physically won\u2019t be able to drink as much (good for learning how much alcohol your body can handle, and acclimating your body to alcohol). 2. You\u2019ll be that one annoying prick in the morning who wakes up after a night out with no hangover \ud83d\ude02\n\nI\u2019ve learnt over the years that shots, spirits, liquor, just don\u2019t do my body any favours. This isn\u2019t diabetes related, just me not being able to stomach strong alcohol.\n\nThe advice about sticking to beer is good, as it can be gassy, and fills you up quicker, so you physically can\u2019t drink as much alcohol. Same sort of deal as the drinking water in between.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 10:</b> I measured how many milliliters are in my average mouthful. For me 1 gulp is about 50 mL and a sip is about 25 mL. I took different sized mouthfuls of water and spat them into a bowl on my food scale. Did that enough times to find my average. \nWhen I drink i know how much carbs are per 100mL and the math is pretty simple, just need to keep track of how many sips/gulps u take. I have a scoreboard of how much i drank in my head that i can visualize.\n\nThis is also a good hack for if you need to correct a low with a beverage and you dont have any measuring cups\u203c\ufe0f\n\nWith beer and hard cider i bolus per usual. With hard alcohol i always eat something with it and bolus around 70% of what i usually would(for carbs in food and alcohol combined) For wine i bolus for 25% of the carbs but dont need to eat while drinkinkg (although i usually am lol).\n\nI always eat a handful of nuts and chocolate chips before going to bed after drinking bc its a good fat:carb:protein ratio for me<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 11:</b> I was diagnosed at 16, 20 yrs ago. I felt the need to feel *normal* and do normal teen stuff. You can have fun, but please utilize your CGM and don't feed the urge to keep pushing things. I drank in college too, and sometimes I wonder how I didn't die. Drinking too much can spike your sugars like crazy, and then while you're hungover drop like crazy, and when you feeling like dog turds after having a few too many, it's harder to stay on top of actually taking care of yourself, it's not worth it. I wish I could tell my younger self to cool it drinking heavily with peers, having fun and imbibing is not a competition, enjoy your time with friends without thinking you need to drink *all* the drinks. If cannabis is kind to you, it's more fun blazing instead of tying too many on, you won't lose your wits/senses like you will with alcohol. Having fun and exploring is a part of growing up, but please be kind to yourself and please take advantage of the info your CGM provides in this time of discovery. Be safe and trust your common sense!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 12:</b> Assume that you need less insulin when you have been drinking. Especially is you're out dancing, you might not need to correct for highs. \n\nDon't drink on an empty stomach. \n\nAlways carry glucose tablets and snacks. \n\nEducate your friends what to do in case you get too low. \n\nAlways eat something (perhaps even without bolusing) before you sleep.<br><br>\n"}

Sometime blood sugar goes up, sometimes it goes down. Every brand and type of beer will be completely different and they don't need to label the nutritional values on the labels (at least here in the UK) \n\nI tend to drink wine or spirits when going out. They don't have any effect on my blood sugar until i go to sleep when it can drop potentially dangerously low. I lower my basal shot and also make sure i eat before bed. Something fatty like a bag of crisps (potato chips) is perfect for me as they keep slowly releasing carbs for a long time.\n\nHave fun and stay safe. Do not get blackout drunk as that could literally kill you as a diabetic. Don't listen to peer pressure. I still get it sometimes in my 40s and they can fuck right off. I'm not dying for them.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 14:</b> The golden rule is to have a light snack before passing out at the end of the night.\n\nAlso just be very cautious about drinking sweet drinks that require injections. Because with the delayed response from the alcohol you can sink very low a few hours after. It's best to keep the drinks low carb so your blood sugars are predictably flat throughout the evening.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 15:</b> Best advice i ever got, was not to eat at least 3 hours before alcohol... \nYes youll have a stronger effect but...\n\nthis way the food  affects on bg wont mix with alcohols affect...\n\nYoull get drunk more easily , so youll drink less for the same buzz...\n\nWich means less kcal from alcohol...less hangover...\nLess spikes in bg...\n\nAnd also for the first couple of times reduse insulin a bit so u can test how your body reacts...\n\nOu and yes...choose your poison and stick to it...because different drinks will affect you differently...<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 16:</b> Drink with moderation and have some low supplies as well as insulin with you. I would also suggest with each drink to drink a glass of water. Spread out your drinks and watch your readings. Also remember it can continue to affect you hours later so make sure you have so supplies nearby when you go to sleep.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 17:</b> Low % lager and spirits are the best way to drink safely I\u2019ve found. Lager above 5% sends me into the 20\u2019s but 4.5% and below acts like water. Spirits don\u2019t move my levels either way, but you are far more likely to make a bad decision injection or food wise if you\u2019re a bit drunk. \nGood luck geezer.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 18:</b> To be honest, my advice is to leave it alone. But in the real world, most of us will have some drinks eventually. I drank heavily in my 20s, until I got a DWI with a BAC of .0202 so I was over double the legal limit at that time. The whole experience was dangerous - you don't want to go to jail as a T1 - and served as my wake up call.\n\nThe important thing is to have some self control. I only go out and drink a couple times a year, I catch a little buzz, and that's it. A few weeks ago I went for dinner and a concert. I had two lite beers (5 carbs each) and two glasses of whiskey (very little to no carbs). This was over the course of about 4 hours. I had a little buzz for a while but I stayed up until about 1am and it wore off. Around 5am I had a mild low in my sleep, down to the low 60s. The CGM didn't wake me for about an hour. It turned out to be not a huge deal, but the combination of sleeping heavy after drinking and low BG can be dangerous. If I had been wasted, it probably would've been a lot worse. Getting really drunk also leads to bad choices, like getting the drunk munchies and eating a bunch of waffles at 2am. That's why I tend to err on the side of caution and drink very moderately...<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 19:</b> Alcohol slightly lowers bg and carbs raise bg. Same as always, the trick is to know your carb intake. I drink often and am a relatively healthy T1D.\n\nMost alcoholic drinks are mixed with carbs to make them go down easier. In the case of hard liquor, the mix will determine how to dose insulin (Coke, orange juice, whatever). Diet sodas don't have carbs so I never take insulin when I drink them, same with light beer. (Easiest drinks to drink and not have to think about)\n\nIf you drink regular soda or fruit juice to mix or heavy beers or wine, you will want to dose yourself based on how much you're consuming. And after too many drinks it becomes easy to lose track and that's when bg issues will arise. Just remember my first sentence and you will be fine.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 20:</b> Make it simple friend. From an ex drinker and long time t1. Don\u2019t. If you\u2019re friends need you to drink, or if you think you need to drink to have friends, you are going to have a long hard life with t1. Or maybe a short one.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 21:</b> I wouldn\u2019t encourage a 16 year old to drink but if you do. Make sure you have food near you if your sugar drops. Whenever I have work events, my go to beer is Budweiser because it\u2019s low carbs and gives me more respect than a white claw. I\u2019m more of a hard liquor person so I like mixing whiskey with diet soda or vodka with soda water and then putting a mio in there.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 22:</b> i don't drink anymore because of the risks, but if you want to drink, here's how i always used to do it incredibly safely (and by that i mean even tho i've been drunk ive never thrown up from it or gotten blackout drunk):\n- #1 advice: have a glucagon kit. learn how to use it and show your friends how to use it. bring an instruction booklet with you where you're drinking. when your liver can't release the emergency sugar you need, the glucagon kit can do it for you. it's like an epi pen for diabetics. \n- my nurses always told me never to bolus for alcohol. if you're eating, bolus for the food, but like has been suggested here already, do lighter boluses. \n- if you have a pump by the time you start drinking, use a temporary lighter basal rate (id suggest -50%). \n- monitor your sugar constantly, every 10 minutes. \n- keep plenty of juice and snacks nearby. \n- in my experience, my sugar goes quite high while drinking/eating - don't correct for it. for me it always plummeted overnight / a few hours later when your body is getting rid of the alcohol. if you're going to sleep, set an alarm for 2 hours and have juice by your bed, or have a friend/family member nearby to check on you overnight. \n- if your sugar is dropping and you feel too drunk to know how to fix it/fix it quickly, don't waste any time: call 911 right away. our bodies as t1ds cannot recover from low blood sugars while drunk. get to a hospital asap because they have glucagon and can help you much faster. \n- pace yourself drinking. you don't have to be wasted to have fun being drunk. this might mean you drink less than others but you can still enjoy it. don't do a ton of shots, go for ciders, or mixed drinks. avoid cocktails with huge alcohol content (like sharing a pitcher of sangria), or wine with high alc. content.\n- if you're having a mixed drink, ask for the diet version, so a rum and Diet coke, etc. Mixed drinks with a lot of soda or soda water will be hard to manage because they'll make your sugar go way up then go crashing back down. \n- my last advice is do what makes you comfortable. if drinking feels too scary that's okay. in my experience, when you tell people you don't drink because you're diabetic they're always immediately understanding. \n- if you have a good endocrinologist or diabetes nurse ask them for advice too. like someone mentioned we're not medical experts. however as many of us know, sometimes doctors are stupid about type 1, lol. but hopefully you will have a nurse or endo you really trust one day :) \n\nhope that helps op. you'll be okay as long ed you're careful!<br><br>\n <b>Comment 23:</b> I find that liquors mixed with a diet or zero sugar mixer hardly affects me. Hard seltzers are amazing too. Like no effect on BG and I have never noticed any kind of after effect with them either. As with anything be responsible and keep an eye on your sugar. But I don\u2019t think alcohol has to be this off limits indulgence that some people make it out to be. Another good idea is to have a close friend or significant other with some basic DM knowledge follow you on the dexcom app so you have a second pair of eyes. Low BG can notoriously resemble someone that is intoxicated. Go out with a fast acting sugar in your pocket for emergencies. But only use it if you can\u2019t get a reg soda first. I once ran into a girl that happened to be T1 with a BG in the 50s and the bars had just closed so we we\u2019re struggling to find a street vendor to get her a reg soda. Don\u2019t let yourself get into this situation. \n\nI personally recommend Trancend gel packets. I buy them in bulk on Amazon.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 24:</b> Getting used to the feeling of alcohol will be your best help. The first time I drank heavily, I was paranoid that I was low because of how I felt when I was intoxicated. Once I got used to the feeling of alcohol then managing type 1 became easier. Start drinking less and don't get pressured into drinking more than you can handle or want to. Keep yourself safe. Have one of your friends remind you to test. Drink sugar-free if possible.<br><br>\n"}

Yes, if I forgot to bolus, or gave too little insulin for a meal, if I\u2019m super stressed or getting sick, even from lack of sleep. It\u2019s just a lot easier to deal with that safely.

Just because you take insulin doesn't make you a true t1 - so that is likely why you are having such issues with the insulin resistance. Your diet shouldn't have to be modified to extremes in terms of low carb - your body needs the carbs, especially if you're diabetic. The endo/ team should help you figure out your insulin amounts/ requirements (basal and rapid acting - insulin: carb ratio) so that you can be covered properly. It never hurts to try out different docs until you find one that works well with you. Sending lots of luck....<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 9:</b> Keto did not work for me. I tried for a few years.\n\nMy carb ratio was way higher (needed more insulin for carbs) than when I wasn\u2019t doing keto.\n\nFor example, 5 grams of carb normally raises my bgl by 10.

Best not to treat it as a part of a chemical reaction equation.\n\nFor how long/how hard do you need to signal the body to rest/store energy? Take enough of the right insulin to tell it that.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 13:</b> Ive been low carb for years and its an amazing tool.\n\nYou need to dose for protein and your glucose tolerance will adapt, therefore you will need to dose more aggressively for the small amount of carbs you might eat, plus a unit or two more of slow release insulin.\n\nAside from those issues, the reason low carb is beneficial for myself is it reduces the amount of total insulin i need every day which adds up to quite a lot over a few years. This also means im far less prone to hypo\u2019s or hyper\u2019s because theres just less room to make big mistakes.\n\nIt is a tricky diet to get right though for some. Ide suggest tracking your food with an app and avoiding any processed \u201clow carb\u201d food, just stick to the boring foods like meat, dairy, nuts and green low glycemic vegetables. Some protein powders and bars can be particularly glycemic as well due to the protein being so processed, so you will need to dose for those 100%, but beef/eggs not as much.\n\nHope that helps, good luck with everything.<br><br>\n"}

{"id": "12q3acm", "text": "<div class='post' style='user-select:none;'>\n  <h2>Post</h2>\n  <p>How do I get a pump? I'm not perfect.\nHey guys!\n\nSo I've read a ton of posts on this sub and others about people getting new pumps. I've asked my endocrinologist about it but she told me that in order to get a pump I need to have my blood sugars no lower than 85% in range for 30 days, with most days being 100% in range.\n\nI think a pump would actually make my life a lot easier because I wouldn't be forgetting or missing shots. Nor would I be accidentally giving myself too much insulin.\n\nI'm just wondering what you guys do to keep your sugars so in target to qualify for a pump? I've tried diets and crazy carb counting, but the only way I ever seem to get it close to 100% is by correcting my morning feet-to-floor syndrome and then basically not eating all day because eating will affect my blood sugar. But that leaves me hungry and generally in an awful mood all day.\n\nI'm in Toronto Canada \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Get a new doctor. Most go on pumps to get better control. If we were all that great on shots pumps wouldn\u2019t be considered the standard of care for T1Ds. Btw my endo begged me to get on a pump to improve my bs when I was in college.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Always unpopular opinion, but stop eating carbs aside from non-starchy veggies.   Try it for 2 weeks.  If you aren't above 95%, go doctor shopping like the other guy suggested.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> So in Manitoba pediatric care they require 3 consecutive a1cs under 10. I've never seen anything harder for requirements but damn yours takes the cake.\n\nI know that our endo clinic is very conservative and want to make sure those on the pump know it's not a cure all for lowering a1c or dealing with issues you have from MDI. However I've known some who have successfully convinced the clinic to relax a bit with the following.  \n1) researched and documented plan for which pump and why.  \n2) printed academic articles stating that pumps are beneficial to those struggling with higher a1cs.  Use google scholar there are many available though you want to find free ones to print. \n3) concurrent use of cgm to monitor for lows. \n4) proof of Basal and carb ratio testing for different times of day. \n\nIt's a lot of work, especially when other endos will just prescribe pumps easily. Also, if you are able to figure out how to build loop, you only need to find someone willing to part with dash pods to get started (though I wouldn't recommend as you won't know what to do for Basal rates at first).<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> I have never heard of such a thing.  I would, if possible, find a new endo.  You should be able to try a pump if you want to.\n\nAlso, you can actually give yourself too much insulin with a pump, if you enter the wrong carb amount.  \n\nThe pump works wonders for the Dawn Phenomenon and the \"Feet to Floor\" syndrome and can be a great tool that helps you deal with those.  \n\nI personally prefer DMI and have about 85-87% in range with it but am on Omnipod because I promised my endo to give it a try.  There are benefits to both, but if the morning glucose rises are the things holding you back from better control, I would push to try it.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Holy shit I hate that approach! A pump, or new pump makes control easier. Withholding a script for a new pump is bullshit! I\u2019d give him a piece of my mind, then switch docs. I\u2019m so tired of the state of healthcare. F$&K!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Back in 2000 when I first got mine the only caveat was how often I was willing to prick my fingers. If you already have a CGM it should be a no brainer.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> No offense but your Endo is a quack. The idea of getting on a pump is to best regulate blood glucose. Unless there\u2019s something in the Canadian healthcare system? \n\nYou could contact the pump company (I just started on the Omnipod with my Dexcom, and I highly recommend it!!) and ask them directly- they are sales reps highly motivated to help you navigate the process.\n\nAlso, if there is an organization to whom you can report this Endocrinologist, incredibly poor medicinal advice, I would try to do so. If they\u2019re saying this to you, they\u2019re saying this to God knows how many other diabetics and giving them terrible advice as well.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> I went to a brand new endo and said \u201chey my son is getting on a pump, I haven\u2019t seen a doctor in over 7 years for my diabetes, can you please write me a prescription and put a rush so I can start around the same time as him?\u201d And she said \u201cof course! I\u2019ll check on you in 3 months\u2026\u201d got my pump about 8 days later.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 9:</b> 100% agree with everyone who says get a new doctor.  We got my son on a pump days before he turned 3 years old and 5 months after diagnosis.  No way were we in the 85% at that point.  His endo wanted us to have time to learn the basics and be comfortable giving shots and finger pokes so that if any of his tech failed, we could go back to MDI no problem.  That was our only requirement before getting a pump.  It has definitely helped with getting and keeping him in range.  It\u2019s also easier to dose or check and see if you did for those times that you just can\u2019t remember if you did or not.  Having a pump has been a game changer for all of us (as well as the Dexcom).  \n\nI am not a resident of Canada, so I can\u2019t offer any advice in regards to getting one there.  But, I will say that fighting to get a pump is worth it.  My son started on the Tslim Control IQ and is now on the Omnipod 5.   Both are great and helped keep him in range.  We started on the Tslim because it was the only one at that time that directly communicated with his CGM.  We switched to the Omnipod 5 when it offered the same, because it meant no more fanny packs and no more tubes for a now active 5 year old.  We\u2019ve had more pods fail than Tslim site fails, but it\u2019s a negligible amount.  But, I\u2019ll step off that soapbox to reiterate that in the end, any pump is worth at least a shot if it means potentially better control and an easier life with diabetes.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 10:</b> My son is 11 and we were told while he is \u201cwell controlled\u201d at 7+, he needs a pump to get better control. She stressed that it was literally the only way we would get his numbers looking better and he\u2019s now on omnipod 5. It\u2019s amazing. Not perfect, but he\u2019s like 60% in range which I\u2019ll take over the MDI while we get the hang of it ( he\u2019s only been on the pump two weeks)<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 11:</b> Look into the assistive device program, those are not the qualifications to get funding for a pump. \nAlso I can only speak from my experience but give Medtronic( or other pump manufacturers a call) they do a great job helping you get one since the supplies is where they make their money<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 12:</b> Get a different doctor. If you were in range majority of the time, you wouldn\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d a pump. A pump is meant to make diabetes treatment easier while still having a lot of control.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 13:</b> Oshawa Ontario here. I was told the only requirements are my son needs to be diabetic for a full year. His year is up so im doing a pump info session on the 25th then have a pump readiness appt July 4. I\u2019d see a new dr<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 14:</b> I totally agree with the consensus among the legends - get a new Endo. Yours is bananas.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 15:</b> I was so terrified to get a pump because my pediatric endocrinologist told me the same thing. I was also told that the complications would be worse if I was uncontrolled on a pump so I refused to go on one until last year and it was the best decision I ever made! \n\nI know endocrinologists are hard to come across (at least in the US), but definitely try to find a more supportive one. Getting on a pump can only improve your blood sugars if you\u2019re using it correctly.\n\nGood luck in your pump journey!<br><br>\n"}

But for me, the pump lets me maintain that time in range without the mental load I was carrying (because I'm insane and obsessive) and has allowed me to chill the fuck out with my diabetes.

Mine (tslim) has an exercise mode which I turn on 1.5 to 2 hours before climbing or running and it slowly reduces the amount of basal insulin on board. Then I get waaay less lows which exercising.

I\u2019ll start playing tennis at 180, eat some skittles in like an hour, maybe drink a juice another hour after that, and still end up low to often. I usually play tennis for 3-4 hours so I always bring candy just in case but I\u2019m really getting tired of eating so much god dam junk. My levels are so unstable when I play.

Could eating some longer chain carbohydrates that take longer to break down help?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Try to exercise with very little to no insulin on board. For me this was either exercising early in the morning when I just woke up or waking up pretty early (7am) having breakfast and bolusing as normal but then only exercising at 11am.\n\nTry figure out when your insulin peaks, my insulin always brings down my blood sugar drastically at 1hr 30 mins - 2 hr after bolusing.

Sorry it has been such a nuisance, it\u2019s awesome you keep at it despite the lows.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Aerobic exercise (cardio, which tennis is) will burn sugar.

Also be ready for the later hypo that can happen a few hours after exercise but usually a nice carby meal takes care of that (mine was always a bowl of porridge). \n\nA little tip I learned from my diabetes nurse & bizarrely it does work; if I was heading downwards do a quick burst of very intense running and it does bring your sugars up! No idea of the science behind it but it works!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Right: you have a good basis, but it\u2019s not actually the best thing to do here, (it\u2019s not your fault, and I\u2019m not blaming you, you just need to readjust)\n\n1. Do you take basal morning or evening, or both? If it\u2019s both or morning, consider taking a unit less on days you plan to exercise.\n\n2. Timing is important. When you tennis, how long has it been since you took your bolus (short acting)? If you eat breakfast and immediately go to play, you will need way less insulin at that meal than if you eat breakfast at 8 but don\u2019t go out to play until 11. Short acting peaks at about 2 ish hours and lasts 4-5, so it might be beneficial to try to nudge your exercise routine to the end of it\u2019s effectiveness, not the beginning. \n\nIf that\u2019s not an option (which sometimes it\u2019s not), you need to be taking less insulin at the meal before sports. Have they covered carb counting and insulin to carb ratios yet? Because that\u2019s quite important. (I have more information on this if you wish to have it)\n\n3. I would also recommend the snacks be less high on the GI scale, and also changing when you take them. \n\nYou have skittles and juice, both of which are basically just pure sugar. I think it would be better if you could add something that raises you slower as well. \n\nFor me, when I\u2019m swimming, I have fruit (usually mango or grapes) about 20 minutes before I start swimming. About 12 grams carbs. Right before I go in, I have two glucose tablets (8grams carbs). I generally end up starting at 8-9 mmol (144-162) and then finishing at 7-8 mmol (108-144). Which is pretty solid. Fruit and milk and fruity yogurts are all healthier options than skittles. Maybe you could try adding them instead?\n\nKeep juice on hand, and have some right before you start, because the fruit/yogurts won\u2019t kick in until about 45 mins after you eat it, because the fibre/fats slow down the absorption of the carbs. You\u2019ll still need some fast acting most likely, but at least you won\u2019t be downing a lot (100ml apple juice is about 11 grams carbs, which is probably the amount I\u2019d start with)<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Check out diabetes training camp teen camp. You\u2019ll get a ton out of it and Dr Matt will set you up for long term success.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> I exercise in the AM when I am more insulin resistant. I have something with protein and fat to keep me stable with no short acting for it. Sometimes this is coffee and cream or a peanut butter sandwhich (depending on how low I am). If it is really intense, then I might add a juice.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> I assume that you aren\u2019t pumping.  On advantage of a pump is turning down basal while exercising.. or just removing it.  This is like not having any long acting bringing you down during exercise.  \nThe other approach possible if using something like lantus is a split dose night and morning\u2026run a reduced long acting during active days.   The disadvantage is you will run higher before and after workouts. And if you cancel workouts you\u2019ll run real high.\n\nGood luck<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 9:</b> The key is to have a lower basal rate during physical activity. If you're MDI, plan a day in advance and lower the basal. If you're on pump, it's much easier to manage. I have 6 basal rates that I select to match what I'm doing next and I select it BEFORE I begin. For tennis and long bike rides, I have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches plus dates with walnuts. I never eat empty calories.\n\nYou might enjoy reading about Bill Talbert, the first diabetic tennis (and Davis Cup) player. He developed his net game so he could limit lows by reducing running back and forth across the baseline... His life inspired me to take up tennis after diagnosis at age 13 in 1965. I still play tennis, ride a bike etc., and use a sensor, pump, with iPhone/Apple Watch. For me, this is the closest thing to a cure until there is one and avoid unexpected lows. My last 7 year average A1c is 5.6 (range 5.4-5.9) without hypoglycemia.\n\nWith Joy and Radiance, Live Long and Prosper<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 10:</b> Sugar is bad at preventing lows, you need calories, not just sugar.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 11:</b> Everyone's T1D is unique, and it really takes time and effort to understand yours and get comfortable managing it.\n\nI *really* struggled with this when I first got diagnosed, in college.\n\nWhat insulin(s) and delivery system do you use? I'm on MDI.\n\nEating protiens,fats, and while wheats can help keep BG up for a period of evercise. Even very sugar rich things like sports drinks or candy bars may raise your sugar very high, but crash back down - the quick sugar rush.\n\nI split my basal in to two doses to avoid lows. After years I kind of found my equilibrium - I take a certain dose of basal, but I *need* to get a certain amount of exercise to keep sugars stable, otherwise they go up. Corrective doses, or even just a 20 minute walk around the block (properly timed) can keep them in check. \n\nI can take one full rest day before they will start to climb. If I know I'm going to be taking a few days off, I increase my basal 10%.\n\nI encourage you to be brave, and experiment (safely) with your body and your habits and find out what works for your diabetes. Keep snacks around.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 12:</b> Granola bars. Those do wonders. Get a higher carb box and a medium carb box. Eat one of the high ones 20 before, and then BC and evaluate after an hour. Tennis is really strenuous, so I would say start with a 30-35 carb bar.<br><br>\n"}

I know celiac is super common w t1d</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> It\u2019s essentially the same thing as T1, only different antibodies and a different target. Instead of attacking beta cells, it attacks the structures in your intestines that break down gluten. If you have the right antibodies, a test can verify celiac.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> I have a celiac's disease diagnosis from just the blood test.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> The celiac test gives false positives sometimes, but no false negatives. So if you pop negative you're good, but if you pop positive and they're not sure, they're gonna get up in ur duodenum for a lil biopsy. Personally I don't think having a related autoimmune disease is gonna hit the accuracy of the test, but I'm not a doctor, and this is probably a better question for one of them.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Some gastroenterologists will give you a diagnosis based on blood test results alone if you meet a certain threshold. Overall, the endoscopy is the gold standard. My son\u2019s GE offered a diagnosis without the scope because his numbers were through the roof but we opted for the scope in case it ever precluded him from qualifying for other things later in life (treatment, insurance, tax exemptions etc). \n\nFWIW my son tolerated it really well at 5 years old.

How does that work?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> We need a little more info here, OP.  Are you on MDI or a pump?  Do you have a CGM?<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> They are probably going to ask you to reduce your basal insulin a bit before the surgery because doctors prefer you run a bit on the high side while they're working on you.   The good thing about wisdom teeth is that they heal-up pretty quickly so you will be able to drink and eat soft foods almost immediately afterwards.  \n\n\nI also have two follow-up questions:  Does your dentist know you're a Type 1?  Does your doctor / endo know you're getting your wisdom teeth done?  If the answer to either of these questions is \"no\", then you need to contact them and let them know because they will most likely have lots of good information to share with you and each other.  Good luck!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I'm confused by the question! The answer is: just like any human being having a surgery. You're only different because your pancreas does not produce enough/any insulin. That has nothing to do with surgery anywhere. I had all 4 horizontal wisdom teeth cut out many years ago in 2 surgeries, but each was day surgery and then back to work/home.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Call your endo<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> I have been concious every time. With a wackload of freezing. Wisdom teeth (2 impacted), pulled infected molar/implant install, root canal and crowns. The infected tooth was the worth. Everything else was not too bad, just the sound of them breaking up the bones for the impacted teeth or having it pulled it really weird.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> I made this several times on MDI. I don't think you need to reduce your basal tbd. The operation only takes a short time, a few minutes and you will probably get locally numbing. \n\nI would eat normally but at least 2 hours before the procedure and then maybe a small snack before to have stable blood sugars, maybe slightly higher than normal. \n\nIf you get low during the procedure you still could drink juice if it has to be. Just come prepared. It is no fun thing for sure but really not worth to get bothered by too much.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> I removed all my 4 wisdom teeth and I didn\u2019t have to do any thing different on my routine. It\u2019s a pretty straight forward surgery. One of mine were infected and twisted so it took a while maybe 2 hours and recovery was painful and slow. Other 3 were around 30 mins and easy peasy recovery. I didn\u2019t find my T1D influenced in any part of the procedures.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> Just make sure your sugars are good before the procedure starts.  You can double check to make sure they know you are an insulin dependent diabetic, but they should already know that.  Will be a quick out patient procedure.  Each wisdom tooth probably anywhere from 1-10 minutes depending on how deeply impacted it is.   You don't have to be sedated unless you want to be.  Can easily be done with just local anesthesia as well.\n\nI am a dentist.<br><br>\n"}
