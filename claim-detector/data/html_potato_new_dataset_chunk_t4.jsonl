That said, insulin needs change. Is there a reason you are concerned about the amount you need?<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Keto or low carb diets will cause some insulin resistance if that's how you're eating.  If that's the case, you can add in carbs every once in a while to combat this.  Check out carb cycling.  As always, the cleaner the carbs, the better.  Shoot for whole foods, veggies and berries.  \n\nEating \"cleaner\", more whole foods, will help a little in general.

Well, our muscles store and are made of glucose and our bodies use this glucose for energy. What happens when we start building muscle ? The food we eat (glucose) will have a place to go, where does it go ? It goes directly to these muscles instead of just staying in the bloodstream and going nowhere. This is why resistance training improves insulin sensitivity.\n\nyou can read full post here on my blog: https://www.dieabeast.com/weight-training-benefits-for-diabetics/\n\nlift some weights mate....<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> How old are you and how long have you been diagnosed?

As in, my bg has been at its highest in a while (300s) and resistant. Even if I inject to correct, my bg goes down for a bit and then goes back up. I think the resistance is due to the slow meat digestion and the high sugars due to the high calories? \nThis is since dinner yesterday night, around 20 hours ago, where I ate just roasted beef ribs. I ate nothing this entire day, but caved out of hunger now and took metformin with my correction + bolus just in case. I am not in ketoacidosis. \n\nIs there something I\u2019m missing or doing wrong? For context, I ate very little meat before but still had a high protein diet and my sugars were well controlled. I am stepping back and going back to my pea protein shakes in order to try and reset my body back to normal.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> I bolus for fat and protein following the math from the Warsaw method. https://waltzingthedragon.ca/diabetes/nutrition-excercise/reduce-post-meal-spikes-caused-by-fat-and-protein/<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> meat doesn\u2019t have sugar as such but some people do need to bolus for protein. i usually don\u2019t, so i count myself lucky. \n\nHOWEVER \u2014 you also shouldn\u2019t go several hours/a full day without eating. your liver can start to pump out glucose because you still need energy. my best guess is this is what\u2019s happening to you with your BG starting to drop then going back up.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Yeah, this is why the high protein kind of low carb never worked for me. Even when I bolus for protein and fat, it ultimately increases my insulin resistance, and I do much much better on moderate protein. A lot of people have that same experience. A lot of people don't. This is truly a very personal disease that every person kind of has to work out themselves. (And yeah, skipping meals and doing IF doesn't work for me either!)<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> My insulin requirements went haywire when I did really low carb. Seemed like whenever I thought I had the math right I needed more insulin the next time. Fat, protein, carbs, all had big insulin requirements.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Keto doesn\u2019t usually work for T1D.. you typically end up with DKA.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> I suggest you stop doing that. Obviously it\u2019s not working for you and it\u2019s really bad for your kidneys.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> i don\u2019t know enough on this topic but my endo has told me keto can be difficult for diabetics because if you eliminate carbs the second your body finally has some it becomes overly sensitive and will spike your blood sugar<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> Animal fats don't really agree with me so I would go really lean meats.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 9:</b> not to derail, but isn't metformin for type 2 diabetes? Did you put BBQ sauce on your ribs? You do have to bolus for protein, but not much. Try using the Carb Manager app. It will give your total carbs in a meal after you input the items. I am doing keto and BG has never been better.<br><br>\n"}
{"id": "dt7tnd", "text": "<div class='post' style='user-select:none;'>\n  <h2>Post</h2>\n  <p>How much insulin do you take on average? And how much is considered a \u201cnormal range\u201d?\nGenuinely curious about this one. I\u2019ve been type 1 for almost 4 years now, and still learning more about it everyday. \n\nA little backstory as to why I\u2019m interested in this question; since I\u2019ve been diagnosed with t1, I\u2019ve been hospitalized with DKA a few times. Each time the hospital treats it and later give me food and insulin, they would only give me like 4-6 units of insulin with my meals. My normal dosage outside of the hospital is like 12-14.  Is there a reason the hospital would only give me very little? The last time I was treated in the hospital I spoke up about it and told them that I needed more insulin or my blood sugar would just go up again. Has anything similar happened to you?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> The way it works is generally like this - if your endocrinologist or whoever writes your prescription for insulin isn\u2019t consulted and therefore isn\u2019t putting in orders, the attending hospitalist or the endo on call uses a formula based on the range of your age and weight to determine your dose and correction factor/sliding scale.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> I haven't experienced anything like that, but I usually average  40 units a day, and I just switched pumps, and had to up my basal 60 percent, so I think a normal range depends on the diabetic?<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> An acquaintance nurse tells me that sliding scale is a normal practice since the majority of diabetic patients they have are type 2. It seems really dumb that people with access to experts wouldn't try harder but healthcare in America is generally not great.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> That\u2019s odd though, the times my son has gone in, they always ask what his carb/ratio is and they go by it. He\u2019s 1:10<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> The sliding scale ratio is to prevent your body from going into shock. If your coming off DKA bringing back your normal bg range should be done slowly rather than all at once. If it were treated all at once and your body did go into shock you would feel low symptoms for high bgs. I asked about this when I went into DKA and my nurse was amazing with helping me understand what was happening and walked me through the process of my treatment. I have been a type 1 diabetic for 3 years now and have kept it under control for the most part. I find if I'm having a high day to have less carbs and if I spike I will go for a run or throw on a workout video from youtube to help me bring it down. It's mostly knowing what your body needs and finding a balance with your ratios that work for you. I would talk to your doctor about switching ratios with your long acting insulin rather than increasing your meal time insulin if your usually high before meals and are doing a lot of correcting.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> My opinion - endos can be trusted to give a decent starting point for basal and bolus doses, but it\u2019s up to each of us to really dial it in properly.\n\nMy endo started me at 4 units twice a day.  I ran experiments from Bernstein\u2019s book, and ended up at 10 evening and 4 morning.  At random times, he\u2019s suggested more or less, but I do my own experiments and trust my judgement over his.\n\nHe spends about 5 minutes a year looking my data.  I spend that much a day.  Probably more.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> I use carb to insulin ratio and it varies by time of day  and what's going on in my life : in am 20:1 ; afternoon 40:1 and after 6ish 50:1  - we are all different, have different amount of remaining beta cell function, type of diet etc.  This is why we are a flexible, ride the wave  and enjoy the trip group.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> I\u2019m on 36 lantus and 20-40 on average on humalog per day.<br><br>\n"}

It was still romantic, despite the one billion children in the restaurant. \n\nWhile deciding what to order, I came across milkshakes. And I haven't had a milkshake since 2017, when I was diagnosed with t1. My boyfriend asked me if I can actually drink that, since I've told him that I can't drink sugary stuff (unless they contain alcohol, hallelujah) and I realised I'd never asked my dietician about that. So I drank coke zero instead, and I'm getting really tired of that. So so SO tired of coke zero. \n\nCan I have milkshakes? Because honestly I miss milkshakes so much. They're my guilty pleasure.

Yes...\n\nI use a pump so I handle milkshakes and stuff differently. \n\nBut! For sugary drinks like that, if I had to inject, I would prebolus at least 20 minutes in advance. Then freely drink it. That way I make sure the insulin is acting in me and dropping me, at the same time stay in range by drinking the milkshake<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Go ahead a splurge! Just make sure you dose for it. My son gets a treat once a month and it\u2019s all trial and error. Some are harder to figure out than others but you won\u2019t know until you try. Happy Valentines Day!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> You came here to ask if you can have a milkshake but literally banned people against high sugar items from answering, so, you just wanted people to validate your decision, so drink the milkshake. Liquid sugar is extremely hard to bolus for you\u2019re gonna need to watch yourself carefully. Good luck.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> I remember feeling like that for the first few years after my diagnosis.  Drink the milkshake, just monitor a little more than normal if you don\u2019t have a cgm.  You may need to take the insulin in split doses since you mentioned you are on pens, but you can responsibly have a milkshake.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> Mini shakes from sonic are a serious weakness of mine - they\u2019re small enough that the carb load isn\u2019t too insane \ud83d\udc4d<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> A traditional ice cream shake from McDonalds can be 60-100 grams of carbs: https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/product/vanilla-shake-large.html (toggle the sizes) can you? Yes.\n\nDo you want to eat 1/2-2/3 of your daily carb load in one item? It's not a good idea, but you can. \n\nInterestingly enough, because of the fat content, it will not spike as badly, but it will spike for longer (order of 5-6 hours as opposed to 2). Sugary soda (no fat) spikes it higher, faster - in some ways, it is more dangerous.<br><br>\n"}

I don\u2019t have retinopathy, but I\u2019ve seen other women post about it. I know multiple women in the group have had successful pregnancies with retinopathy. You should join. I had a relatively easy, healthy pregnancy with T1- DM me if you have questions.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> I have had retinopathy since my early thirties the primary concern is a lot of the treatment is not available or extremely limited if needed. Pregnancy tends to cause added stress on the cardiovascular system that may already be damaged by diabetes. So that is why they are so concerned with t1 pregnancies. The hormone swings make things really hard to control. So complications can result. For someone like myself, that gets eye shots every 6-8 weeks, I wouldn\u2019t be able to receive them during my pregnancy (my ophthalmologist indicated 1 could be done in an emergency). The ANTI VEGF that stops new blood vessels developing in the eye, is also pretty dangerous to fetus development. So, you kind of have to weigh the risks and rewards.

{"id": "cb9vo5", "text": "<div class='post' style='user-select:none;'>\n  <h2>Post</h2>\n  <p>Can I take an extra small dose of lantus before to counter act overnight spikes?\nHi friends. It is a VERY common occurrence that I go to bed in range (90-150ish) and then I wake up in the 300s. I know that my dinner and slow releasing carbs can be playing a role, but all the way up to 350? Really? \n\nMy question is this: Can I take a small amount of long acting insulin to fight this? Has anyone had this problem while on MDI? \n\nI\u2019m taking a break from the pump and I am not currently wearing a CGM. Help.\n\nUPDATE: I split my long acting dose yesterday. 15U in the morning and 15U in the evening. Ate Chipotle last night at 9pm, woke up at 142! Wooo!!!</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> It\u2019s possible your sugar is also dipping much too low during the night and your body is trying to counteract that, but it then has no way to lower it again before morning comes. Have any of your endos ever recommended setting an alarm to do a middle of the night check (for at least several nights) to see what the problem is?<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> we were having trouble with middle of the night spikes with my toddler, so grain of salt with this comparison. We did splitting long acting with just a unit at night, but from in range and even slightly above range (like 200-225) he\u2019s end up crashing low before morning. We ended up upping his morning long acting a bit so he had more on board, and then stacking his evening doses- regular pre bolus before dinner, plus and extra half unit or so not super long before bed (about an hour later). If you\u2019re going to bed not long after eating, might be something to consider, but set your alarm a couple of times through the night for a couple of days of doing that to see what\u2019s going on for sure.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> If you are sure you have slow releasing carbs that are still coming, you could bolus for them.  You have to be careful, but I\u2019ve never had anything slower than 5 or 6 hours, which is similar to the length of a FIASP shot for me.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> What does your Endo say?? Also, yes, when not on a pump you\u2019ll need long and shot acting insulin.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> If you are MDI, you should be taking some sort of long acting insulin. When my 9 year daughter was diagnosed last year and did MDI, her Lantus ranged from 4-8 units. It was a constant adjustment. We are now on the pump, but she currently has to take 16 units of basal each day rather then Lantus. \nCall your endo. You probably need Lantus adjustment or Lantus in general. Also, it may be good to wake up at 3:00 am and do a correction (do you have dexcom? It\u2019s excellent!)<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> For clarification, I am already taking my long acting insulin every morning at 8am. I was using the Medtronic 670g and the Guardian 3 sensor, but I just needed a break. Too many things connected to me and I was burnt out. \n\nIs it possible that the long acting just starts to wear off at 2 or 3 in the morning? I knows it\u2019s designed to slowly release for 24 hours, but who knows. \n\nYes, I know it\u2019s a good idea to wake up in the middle of the night and check/correct ... I\u2019m just being selfish with my sleep.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> I take 44u levemir per day. I was always high in the morning as well. I started split dosing 22u AM and 22u PM. 12 hours apart per my endo. Morning highs resolved. Have a chat with your endo to see what may work for you \ud83d\ude0a<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> This was happening to me as well, my diabetes nurse told me to split my long acting insulin into two doses (Long acting says it lasts 24hrs in your system but it usually only last around 20hrs)\n\nI was taking 10 units of lantus once a day, but now I take 5 units in the morning and 5 units in the night and I haven't been getting any major spikes since. Maybe this will work for you too?<br><br>\n"}
{"id": "ywm7ez", "text": "<div class='post' style='user-select:none;'>\n  <h2>Post</h2>\n  <p>How am I supposed to get insulin for next year?\nBackstory: I\u2019m 27 and have been on a marketplace insurance plan for a few years now because I make about 34k a year. I\u2019m going to graduate from university and hopefully get an engineering job approximately may or June and average pay for entry level positions here are 75k a year I\u2019ve done some rough math and with my expected income I\u2019ll make too much money and I don\u2019t qualify for any marketplace tax credit and all of the plans that I used to be able to afford are now $600-$700 a month premiums (I pay about $80 now). I can\u2019t afford that on my salary now,, I\u2019m living paycheck to paycheck as is. The cheapest plans dont cover anything and cost 4x as much.\nIn all of the interviews  I\u2019ve had so far I asked how soon I can get coverage after starting,, the average time is 2 months after start date. I suspected this might happen so I have been filing my scripts religiously as soon as I can but here we are in November and I only have enough to last me until April and I likely won\u2019t be able to afford coverage until august! How am I going to get insulin?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Would you ever consider making a move to a country with free health care like the U.K.? I know it\u2019s not an ideal suggestion but it does seem like you\u2019d be much better off somewhere else that would give you what you need without charging you!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Go to Eli lily\u2019s website and get their savings card. Basically it\u2019s a card you get from their website. Very quick and easy. It lets you buy your insulin each month for 45 dollars, regardless of how much you use. So tell your doctor you\u2019re using more insulin and bam you can get a ton of insulin for 45 dollars a month. No insurance needed<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Okay so, it\u2019s not the end of the world. That\u2019s not how it works. (Source: had marketplace insurance and switched mid year because I got a good full time job) You\u2019re going to be okay, please don\u2019t panic. \n\nIt\u2019s income adjusted. You get to keep your marketplace plan until your new workplace insurance kicks in. You get to keep your subsidy until your income changes. So here\u2019s how it works!\n\nNow: renew your marketplace plan or pick a new one. You get a subsidy. Keep refilling your stuff like a champ. \n\nMay: congratulations on graduation! \n\nMay/June/whatever: start your new job AND call the marketplace and adjust to your new income. It\u2019s a form, they were super nice to me when I did it. You will probably lose most, if not all of your subsidy. \n\nJuly/August: your new insurance kicks in. Call the marketplace by mid month to cancel your plan. \n\nIf you forget to adjust and it doesn\u2019t start until the next month, that\u2019s fine. You repay it in your taxes. There\u2019s a max for how much they can make you repay. You will have insurance and insulin. You\u2019ll also start a new deductible with your new insurance which sucks.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> hopefully you find a job that provides coverage immediately. some places have a waiting period, some don\u2019t. i just started a new job and my\ninsurance was effective my first day.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Start hoarding. Tell your endo to write out a bigger need and pick up some extra bottles to last you through the 2 months it'll take to get coverage. Just explain the situation to your doc. He'll try everything in his power to help you survive<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Get your endo to increase your monthly prescription - allows you to build up a back stock. Like mine is written for 3 bottles/month when I probably use just about 2.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> You should be negotiating any salary you're offered and that includes benefits. EVERYTHING is negotiable. You can likely get them to start coverage early if negotiate at the offer stage.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> Most full time jobs offer benefits for the positions you would be looking for.  Shit even Walmart full time employees get the option for health insurance.<br><br>\n"}

I got instructions on how to increase until it stabilized.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> For me, my very long honeymoon was over when I had to dose for fat and protein, for hormonal shifts, for illness, etc. I had been on lower doses of basal and bolus prior to that. I required insulin for fast  rises from carbs, but my body still handled some of the slower impacts for me. My total daily dose basically doubled.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Was not a sudden change, happened slowly over about 9 months, as meals started causing more highs requires more insulin, basal needed to be increased etc.\n\nWe went from about 24 units a day to 50-60, basal doubled as well. Carb ratio went from 15/1 to about 10 now, 8 in the morning<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> If you want glucose levels to look for, my endo told me the numbers to look out for was staying above 180 mg/dL 2 hours after a meal consistently, or waking up above 140 mg/dL consistently<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> Watching my T1 friend, I think you know looking back. I don't think it's easy to know while it's happening. \n\nMy friend knew it was done when her basals, insulin to carb ratios, and correction boluses evened out. She shifted from the short term rollercoaster of the honeymoon phase where mixing your insulin with shots/boluses makes you go low or high--to the long term roller coaster of T1 where you work to tweak your insulin amounts based on stress, activity, hormone cycles, time of day etc.\n\nUnless others know of a way, I think you'll know when things enter a new stable phase for like 3 to 6 months.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 9:</b> maybe you just got diagnosed after your honeymoon period was over? that\u2019s kinda what happened to me, i got sick as a kid and that\u2019s when they think i developed t1d but i wasn\u2019t diagnosed till a couple years later, i was sick most of the time in between being super sick as a kid and diagnosis but i think it\u2019s safe to say i wasn\u2019t diagnosed in my honeymoon phase so i never had to experience it or any of the changes it could have made to my diabetes management. maybe something similar happened?<br><br>\n"}

Currently we have humalog and lispro which we use for MDI which I know the pump can work with. We had been trying to move to lyumjev for MDI and just got a prescription for it. This has a 5 min time to onset instead of the 15 minute with humalog.\n\nBut now we were able to get an appointment for pump setup. So, can we use faster acting insulin like lyumjev with the op5 as well when we get started on the pump? Or does that only work with humalog/lispro/etc with 15 minute time to onset?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> The system isn\u2019t designed for it, but it will probably be fine. Yes, the initial appearance is faster, but the peak blood concentration is still almost an hour out.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> I mean this is a 5 second google search, they did not approve or test or modify the algorithm in OP5 to be used with anything except for Humalog & Novolog.\n\nIdk why you would get a closed loop system and immediately subvert the algorithm by screwing with its data using an insulin it isn't accurately calculating action time for. Like what is the upside? Especially with a 6 year old, that would mean way higher likelihood of lows using an insulin faster than what the algorithm is expecting. Horrible idea.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Yup, I'm using lumjev in my op5<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Insulet hasn\u2019t officially approved it to work with other insulins, but yes it can. The most important thing, in my opinion, would be whether your endo is comfortable with it. Mine was the one to suggest Fiasp, and he double checked with his Education team and they said it\u2019s fine. All have been using it with patients on OP5 since the system launched. I haven\u2019t had any ill effects or bumps in the algorithm since switching.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> I bet it would work, but you may see things like the system thinking you have slightly more IOB than you actually do.\n\nBut, all in all, I doubt it will be a huge problem. If anything, I think it would tend to control highs better at first, and then have lingering \"backside\" stubborness of bg.\n\nLike, when going high, it would likely react strongly at first, bringing you down, but then assume the insulin has more strength left in it than it really does, so it might reduce your basal and you could have some trailing highs in hour 4+.\n\nFor a 6yo, that's probably still a win.\n\n(Android APS or Loop have lyumjev programmed in, so those would work with it without that drawback)<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> I'm in Humalog and Lyumjev with Omnipod 5. I don't change settings when using it. My body just doesn't react to Humalog after a few weeks, but will to Lyumjev. Then it doesn't react as well to Lyumjev and I switch back to Humalog. Basel rates and carb ratio stay the same. Have had no issues with the pod not working due to the change of insulin<br><br>\n"}
