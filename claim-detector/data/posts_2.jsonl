Adding the text here as it didn't show up. \ud83d\ude0a\n___________________\n\nHello! \nRecently I've noticed that my bg almost always drop during the night. I take my Lantus at 11 at night, go to sleep at midnight. Then, around 5 or 6 in the morning, I get a low notification and have to go up and have half a glass of juice and half a sandwich. That usually keeps me ok (rise to about 6mmol) until it's time to go up at 9. Sometimes I drop once more and have to eat again at 8. \n\nEven if I go to sleep at 7-8-9-10 mmol I'll still drop. I HATE waking up to alarms during the night!\n\nI figured my Lantus kicks in too hard and too soon when I take it, so I'd like to take my Lantus in the morning instead. But how do I change that? Split the dose one night, then it's fine to go the next day? Any tips from someone that has changed the timing? \u2764\ufe0f\n\n(Yes, I can call my team, but I'd rather try fixing this by myself. As long as I feel good I can do what I want.)\n\n\nDiabetes t1 since 2008, f31, mdi, libre2. Latest hba1c 42 (ca 5,8%)<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Well, I faced a similar issue. My bg levels dropped during night, while by evening it started to spike. So I figured that it didn't stay in my body for long. What I did was make it half and half across 12 hours period. Gradually, then I adjusted the dosages (earlier I was taking 10 units at night) and started taking 3u at morning and 5u at night.<br><br>\n"}

More info in comments</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> So this is my first day with the dexicom. I\u2019ve had a few drinks tonight some of which were cocktails so high sugar content. Prior to dexicom, I\u2019ve always checked BS before drinking and then I would check before bed, then often in the morning I would be low. I can now see that this trend is very likely to continue at the time of me typing this. \n\nI\u2019ve had no extra insulin, yet for some reason my blood sugar is dropping? Prior to dexicom I only had my snapshot window blood sugar tests, it would show prior to drinking Normal bs, then when I get home, normal bs, and then in the morning I always run low? I take my long term Optisilin (used to be called Lantus) at 7:00 in the morning and this is maybe the only thing I could think that could be causing this? However, during the week where I\u2019ve had no alcohol I don\u2019t run high or run low?? What am I missing???<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> I typically stay away from sugary drinks\u2026.most often light beer.  For probably 15-20 years I was blind to these phenomena as well but I knew be careful when trying to cover alcohol.  \nNow with cgm and tandem I will try to cover alcohol at least early in night\u2026and as the liver begins to shut down sugar I am not covering the drinks.  When I drink excessive amounts I find I get the munchies before passing out.  There have been times where food was eaten and I have no logs showing was covered and blood sugar didn\u2019t rise\u2026.good to have a small snack before bed. I\u2019ve used energy bars for this since they take a while to breakdown into sugar<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Alcohol makes me drop overnight!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Yeah your lantus is peaking.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> I'm skeptical this isn't separate things. Cocktails are not very sugary in most instances, like have you guys made a cocktail ever? Idk what y'all are talking about, that's a major spike. If your idea of a cocktail is whisky and coca cola, then ok lol, you should prob stop that. This really isn't enough data, I think you are not bolusing correctly on your dinner and the alcohol maybe dropped you a bit along with insulin still in your system doing it's thing. But alcohol doesn't usually drop folks 6 hours later, that's not really how it works.   \n\n\n\"I've had no extra insulin\" is a nonsensical statement tho that communicates nothing to help understand what's going on here. But as is, you aren't going low here. There are way too many variables, you aren't nearly specific enough, and you are just getting a feel for it. It takes time, you will develop a much deeper understanding of your body, food, insulin, and diabetes. keep it up!<br><br>\n"}

I'm about to say goodbye on Saturday to my furry Best friend Chelsea. I've had 15 amazing years with her. And now it's sadly time to say goodbye and let her go. She has mammory cancer, chronic pancreatitis, and an intestinal blockage that won't get better without major surgery. But I can't put her through that, there's a high possibility she wouldn't even survive the operation. I've noticed the past week my blood sugar has been pretty elevated staying in the high 200-300 range even with my usual insulin regimen. Has anyone else experienced this in stressful situations? Should I increase my insulin for now? And am I at risk of going dka? Thank you all.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Yes. Stress hormones cause a rise in sugar levels. This is why long term stress is very dangerous.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Yes, stress will elevate blood glucose. You will have to increase your insulin dose to compensate but be prepared for lows when your bg returns to \"normal\" as the stress subsides. If you're on a pump it's much easier to mange because you can raise the basal rate...\n\nLive Long and Prosper<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Sending huge hugs.

I found out a few days before Christmas that my sweet girl has bladder cancer (she\u2019s almost 15) and just the devastation from that news and a lot of crying, gave me insulin resistance. In my opinion, I feel that you need to let yourself grieve and be a little relaxed on your blood sugar levels. Looking ahead for when my girl passes, it will be really difficult and I\u2019ll have to be less strict on my diabetes management temporarily just since life will be difficult enough as it is.

I\u2019ve been a diabetic for a little bit over a year now and I need to start giving myself insulin shots, I\u2019m not scared of needles however when the time comes for me to give myself a shot I just can\u2019t do it. I was wondering if there is any advice for being able to give yourself a needle and was also curious about others experiences giving themselves their first needles.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> I was definitely scared of needles to start with. I had to have a friend show me even finger pricks before I would try it. \n\nIt's terrifying, it's nerve wracking, and in the end, the anticipation and worrying is ABSOLUTELY so much worse than the actual needle. I did needles for about a year before switching to a pump, and maybe 1 in 10 actually \"hurt,\" approximately as bad as a moderate pinch.\n\nA badly placed finger prick is worse than the worst needle I've had, and it doesn't even hurt as long as a bad finger prick.\n\nI'd suggest started by using the needle in your abdomen, and when you're used to it, try side thigh or back of arm. \n\nSometimes they'll bleed, but usually with very little pain. I'd recommend getting those little circle bandaids if you're worried about stains, but I never did.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Your first few times giving yourself shots are always the most difficult to do, but eventually once you do it enough it becomes as mundane an activity as any other. I\u2019ve been a T1 for about 12 years (plus some change), I can tell you it definitely gets easier but you just have to slowly train yourself into a \u201cmind over matter\u201d mentality about it. Remind yourself of a few things: it\u2019s not going to hurt nearly as bad as you think, you need this insulin in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle, you\u2019ve been receiving insulin for a little over a year now, and anything else you can think up that helps you psyche yourself into administering the shot. You just gotta pump yourself up so you can get over that paralyzing anxiety hurdle that stops you cold at the last second.\n\nWhen I was younger, I used to be so afraid of getting shots that I would hide from my mom whenever I knew we were going to eat because I didn\u2019t want to test or do my insulin. Eventually though, I got comfortable with it after I practiced telling myself that it wasn\u2019t going to hurt, and I found that helped so much in reducing the anxiety I was feeling about doing insulin. When I was comfortable with that knowledge, it was only a hop, a skip, and a jump for me to learn to draw up my own shots and start doing them myself.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> For me, I\u2019ve found that meditating before doing it really helps. I know it sounds weird, but if you\u2019re more calm and relaxed it\u2019s actually much easier. I personally would just close my eyes and focus on things opening to get this idea of my skin being more open to the needle, less mind friction I guess. Idk, but it worked for me. Good luck, there\u2019s lots of ways to make the issue better without giving up for sure.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Try and buy a steady shot it helps you get used to giving yourself insulin and goes for about 24.99 on Amazon. I have one and highly recommended it to anyone struggling to give themselves insulin<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Find a few good spots, take a deep breath as it goes in, maybe watch some tv or something to take your mind off it<br><br>\n"}

She is very stressed out and overwhelmed. For those of you who have been there, what are some things people did or gifts they gave you that helped?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> I know how your friend is feeling, but while diabetes is serious, it doesn't have to be a death sentence. I was diagnosed when I was 8, and am now 39. My daughter was also diagnosed at 3. Watching her go through what I went through was terrible. Anyway, I don't think diabetes has stood in the way of anything I wanted to do, or my daughter. I played active sports, did reasonably well in school, and had sleepovers at my friends houses. Diabetes means extra precautions and planning, but there are no complete barriers to what we can do...well maybe not being an ice cream taste tester. Your friend will get through it, offer support and hugs. While not optimal, their daughter will be stronger for it.\n\nAlthough, I did get a GameBoy when I was diagnosed. That definitely helped. :)<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> I\u2019m so sorry to read this. Receiving the diagnosis is devastating and having to learn how to manage the condition, while managing your emotions and that of a child makes the early days the hardest part of the journey (as far as we know so far).  But as the other poster has stated, your friend\u2019s daughter will still be able to live a happy, fulfilling and active life.\n\nMy daughter was diagnosed when she was 5 and is now 7.  She is a very sensitive child emotionally and would hate having the injections - fighting and kicking us when it was time.  If your friend\u2019s child is struggling, I highly recommend Buzzy - a vibrating bee / ladybird which you can hold against the injection site to distract from the sensation of the needle.  My daughter still uses Buzzy now when it is time to change Dexcom.\n\nWe tried the injections and finger pricks ourselves (new needles and lancets obviously) to show our daughter it was \u2018ok\u2019 to do it and because she said that we didn\u2019t understand the pain and she wanted us to feel.  \n\nWe also used lots of rewards in the early days - whatever we could do just to get through.  She now has a very large collection of Shopkins!  \n\nDexcom blood glucose monitor makes life a lot easier for us - my daughter sleeps through hypos and the alarm sounds and wakes us up when she goes low.   \n\nWe also used the iPort to remove the number of injections given through the day - it\u2019s a canula which gets changed every 3 days and insulin injections are given through it by the pen, instead of in multiple places on the body.  This was the biggest help to us.\n\nLast week my daughter was lucky enough to be put onto her first pump, the Omnipod (NHS, we are in England), and we love it.  Being free from getting the injection pens out when we are out and about, and just being able to type a few numbers into the handset to give her insulin is a complete game changer.  We love that it has no tubing and have enjoyed (if that word can be used with diabetes) decorating the \u2018pod every 3 days.\n\nTell your friends to hang in there.  Life will be complete shite for a few weeks, maybe a few months, and there will be good days and bad.  But at some point it will become a new \u2018normal\u2019 for your friend\u2019s family and daughter.\n\nOur daughter has grown up faster than her friends, I think.  She has a level of maturity and understanding of health and food that her friends are oblivious to. She has become quite confident and assertive around adults too, since she has now spent lots of time with the doctors, nurses, dieticians etc expressing her views and wishes.  \n\nIt\u2019s really nice that you are wanting to help them.  Learn all you can for yourself, because sometimes it\u2019s nice for parents to have someone to talk to who \u2018gets it\u2019.  Those that don\u2019t deal with it really don\u2019t understand the impact, so it\u2019s wonderful that you seem to want to get involved.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Her husband is out of town on business so I went with them yesterday for the hospital visit and first educational session. After a few finger pricks and shots, Millie was ready to fight if anyone even mentioned another one, so I\u2019ll definitely get them a buzzy to try. We did finger pricks with her but she was not impressed lol \n\nThey ordered her a Dexcom at the hospital yesterday, so hopefully within the next couple of weeks they won\u2019t have to do finger pricks anymore. I think they have to wait a while before they can consider a pump, but I\u2019ll make sure she hears about the iPort. I think reducing number of injections may be hugely helpful for them. \n\nI think I\u2019ll show her these posts. I imagine you\u2019re right. She\u2019s going to need people who get it, and seeing that there\u2019s not only people in her life who care but also a wider, global community of people who are having similar experiences and can promise it gets better will be encouraging for her.<br><br>\n"}

So, no even eating a whole meal before an A1c test shouldn\u2019t raise your A1c. If I\u2019m wrong here feel free to correct.<br><br>\n"}

{"id": "gifrmp", "text": "<div class='post' style='user-select:none;'>\n  <h2>Post</h2>\n  <p>How does it feel when BG is too high?\nI have a 19 month old recently diagnosed T1D - because she\u2019s so small and young, the doctors have been letting her BG stay higher than if she were older, since a low drop would be so risky. (By the way, I\u2019m very stressed and if you disagree with this method, please don\u2019t tell me any frightening reasons why - I really need to just trust our doctor right now and I\u2019ve seen so many things to be scared of for her... by the way, we\u2019re only 1 week from diagnosis, so we\u2019re still adjusting and changing doses and figuring this out, so this isn\u2019t because we\u2019re going to KEEP her at this level, it\u2019s just while we find the balance. Plus we\u2019re still in honeymoon phase).\n\nWe only correct with novalog if it\u2019s over 200 or for every 20g carb. So even with correction she\u2019s been hanging around 250-320 BG and I just wonder how this may make her feel?... is it completely different for everyone? Or are there some common general feelings, like jitters, shakey, angry? It\u2019s so hard to tell what may be BG and just \u201ctoddlerness.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> When my blood sugar is high, I feel lethargic. Honestly like I just want to curl up and maybe nap. Sometimes I feel a little cloudy mentally with highs and since I manage my own sugars, highs stress me out which doesn\u2019t help the cycle of getting my sugars down. \nThe shaky feeling is normally low sugars for me.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> It just makes me feel really tired and sluggish when my blood sugar is too high.  I'm thirsty and have to go to the bathroom a lot (which is my body's way of trying to get rid of the excess sugar). It's like how eating a big carb heavy meal makes anyone feel really- you just want to take a nap!\n\nThe jitters, shaky, short tempered, unable to focus feeling comes with low blood sugar.\n\nAnd don't worry about her hanging out higher than she \"should be\" right now.  It took me a good month after diagnosis to bring my blood sugar down to a consistently normal level.  It takes some time! it's almost like detoxing.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> You're generally going to see the jitters and shakiness with a low. There aren't  many visible cues when it comes to a high, outside of witnessing the possible increased thirst and urination. It's also usually a lot harder for us to tell if we're high as opposed to feeling a low.\n\nThe most common symptoms are feeling tired and mentally foggy, and a lot of us can get more irritable and cranky. It's hard to describe, but sometimes for me it feels like all the veins in my body are being inflated or are swelling up, like they're trying to push their way out of my body to release the pressure. It's not a painful feeling, just sort of uncomfortable.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> I feel very stuffed I guess is how I\u2019d say it, like there\u2019s styrofoam in my knees and limbs and I usually stretch a lot when that happens. \n\nMy breath also starts to smell very fruity and I look very red, so I\u2019d see next time if her breath smells like that when she\u2019s high it might be a good indicator if it does happen.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Lethargic, smell weird, shaky, and I personally get sleepy to avoid feeling bad. It\u2019s inevitable having IOB but knowing in your heart you need a bolus at that time because ur BG is rising and you feel it.<br><br>\n"}

Eg basics<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Ignore what the T2 tells you. There is no \"right\" answer except the one that works for her.\n\nYou'll get as many opinions as people that reply, and each of them will be the answer that works - for that poster.\n\nMy wife eased into it. She listened to me, did her own research, and knew where the boundaries were. The only time she makes decisions or gives me unsolicited input is when she beats the CGM to knowing that I might be trending downwards. Apart from that, she listens, offers opinions when asked, and says the right thing when I moan.\n\nShe doesn't hand glucose to me, follow me on the CGM, or hold my hand. We're two adults and she trusts me to handle my shit. She cares, but knows I'm the worst patient in the world and hate fussing.\n\nOthers around here will tell you that they like their partner to fetch the juice box or candy when they go low, or need more care taken of them. And that's fine, that's their preorgative.\n\nAll of which is a long way to say that the only right answer is the one that she gives you. Ask her what she needs physically and emotionally. Take that information and be prepared to adapt it as your relationship evolves.<br><br>\n"}

They should give you a number to start with. If you have one it\u2019s pretty straight forward. Let\u2019s say your ratio is 1 unit for every 10 gram of carbs. You eat 40 grams, you\u2019d take 4 units. Unfortunately insulin to carb ratios are very individualized so no one on here can give you an exact starting point. It\u2019s based on a variety of factors including your total daily insulin amount.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> If you don't know your insulin/carb ratio, try to estimate that from the recurring meals you usually have. Probably it won't be perfect, but a good starting point to figure it out (also for the future)<br><br>\n"}

Once treatment price comes down and it's cheaper to cure then maintain (with insulin, syringes, cgm, pump, etc), then insurance will cover. \nOf course I'm not an expert, that's how I've seen trials and insurance work. \nAm I jaded?
