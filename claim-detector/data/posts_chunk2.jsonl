I had been started on an insulin pump and got help creating a special basal rate just for the premenstrual time.  I had to keep track and remember but once I turned it on, it helped with my numbers.  Not sure what to do with the irregularity tho\u2026makes it hard to predict but perhaps if your numbers start creeping upward for no apparent reason that is your cue?<br><br>\n"}

I\u2019ve been doing research here and there and see overall great results, mixed with nausea and some bad lows. \n\nHas anyone had success starting one of these drugs and avoiding lows? I\u2019ve seen people mention a total daily insulin reduction of 25%-50%. Maybe I reduce basal down 25 or 50% from the get go and see how much the GLP-1 drug contributes and increase insulin from there if needed? \n\nAny input is much appreciated!</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> I\u2019ve tried both, no issues with lows. I have a tslim and it will just reduce my basal if needed.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Took 4th dose of 0.25mg today. Was on Lantus + Apidra earlier. Take 0.25mg Ozempic weekly, plus 18U Lantus daily + 2-4 units Apidra if BS spikes over 250.   \nPrior to Ozempic, my BS was wild stayed above 250 usually and will get 3-4 hypos in a day if increased either basal or bolus. Before breakfast I would wake up with BS around 130 and upon walking up to freshen up, before doing anything (like within 15 minutes getting out of bed) eating anything BS would spike to 180... ON FASTING STOMACH. It does not happen anymore \\~ high BS spikes are much controlled. Response to short acting insulin is much better. But I get a daily hypo around 6-7 AM if I am not hyper-vigilant. Sucks. Usually I wake up at 9-10 am not before that. But cant afford rn.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I am a T1 who has been on Saxenda for about 2 months. I use O5 and G6. I have had 2 bad lows in this entire time, and honestly, think that the second one came about as a result of alcohol. I was at a music festival at an all inclusive resort with friends who drink a lot and honestly having 2 drinks a day along with edibles over the course of 4 days, by the last night, I had a horrific low that wasn't even registering on G6 and I had to administer glucagon. I do not think that it was my medication, more that blip in my lifestyle radar. (In my normal life, I have like 2 drinks a week, maybe.) When I got home, I told my endo and she had me change some settings in manual mode, but since then, I haven't had any lows. \n\nI saw my endo and my A1C decreased from 7.1 to 6.6, my TIR is absurd, like 90%, and I have lost about 15 pounds. This is only 2 months in. I did have side effects in the beginning, head aches, queasiness, I vomited twice mostly due to eating too close to bed time (your stomach empties slower), but overall, it's a pretty big help. \n\nI think about it this way. In normies (without obesity, but with a pancreas), there is an organ that secretes all of these hormones to keep us in check. There aren't ONLY (insulin secreting) beta cells in your pancreas, there are 5 cell types that secrete a whole bunch of hormones -glucagon, insulin, somatostatin, ghrelin, and pancreatic polypeptide. For us, our pancreas is destroyed, but by only taking insulin, we are only replacing that one hormone and not the other hormones that have also been taken out as a result of the autoimmune process. \n\nMy endo also had me not go up to the highest dose, which would have been my next step. I am currently at 2.4 mg daily. It is still working well. \n\nGood luck, and hope you don't have any issues finding your med! It's a problem and whatever you do, DO NOT USE COMPOUNDED PRODUCT. Use only the innovator product in pens.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> I kept my basal the same and split bolus for meals, that way I can increase/decrease on the second half as needed. Haven't had any problems. Overall lowered my bolus intake probably 30-40%.<br><br>\n"}

Or maybe you missed your basal injection? Maybe your insulin has gone off. I'd start with changing your insulin if possible. If you have missed the basal insulin, you will need significantly more insulin to remain stable, do that until your next scheduled basal injection, don't double up basal if you are not sure whether you took it or not.\n\nIf you are ill you will likely need more insulin to remain in range aswell.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> It sounds like maybe basal is off?

With all that water came me having to pee A LOT I would go almost every 10-20 minutes school was absolute hell they refused to let me refill my water bottle or to let me go to the bathroom I had to hold it until I was in so much pain I was in tears I would go to the nurse and tell her something was wrong but she just told me that I was trying to skip class and go home early I would go in the bathroom stall and cry my eyes out this went on for pretty much two months until the end of November came around it was thanksgiving break and I was home from school nobody was home that day so I took that opportunity to drink everything in sight until suddenly around 3 o,clock I started to have feelings of acid reflux or so I thought they were so bad and painful I called my older sister on my iPad and told her how much pain I was in and that I wanted somebody to come home of course she couldn\u2019t because she lives in a different state but she was the only one that would answer my calls after about one hour of talking to her I hung up and took a nap I woke back up at 5 with the worst feeling in my chest like burning and acid I coul barely move my body without the paw increasing so I crawled out into the living room and still nobody was home at that point I crawled onto the couch and laid there almost lifeless until someone arrived at 8 I told my grandma that I wasn\u2019t feeling good snatch that I think I should go to the ER and she replied with that they would say the same exact thing that it was just acid reflux and it would be a waste of time and money. I rolled over and cried into a pillow I accidentally cried myself to sleep and woke up around 10 and starter to vomit over and over I eventually stopped and crawled back into bed for the night The night was restless I would wake up every one hour sweating hot, needing to go to the bathroom, and in so much pain I would throw up until I had nothing left in my stomach this happened all night until 4 am when I woke up unable to breathe I was gasping for air so much that it felt like my chest would burst I made it into my grandparents room and woke her up telling her I couldn\u2019t breathe she woke up and decided to take me because she thought I had covid so we rushed into the ER I was barely clinging to Consciousness and was so shaky I could barely stand I was still holding back the urge to vomit a really kind nurse asked me if I needed a wheelchair and I nodded my head as that was all I could do after a few moments another lady came out to take me to get my vitals she was the most horrible lady I\u2019ve ever met she looked me up and down with disgusting her eyes and asked me why I was in a wheelchair I was so shocked I didn\u2019t know what to say not that I could say anything at all once we were in a room she repeatedly told me to calm down and stop breathing so fast and hard I tried to mumble at the words I\u2019m sorry to her but my voice was cracking and my throat was so dry she looked at me and told me she didn\u2019t know what was wrong with me\nSuddenly another doctor came in in the moment he came in he had a look on his face that he knew some thing that we didn\u2019t he immediately asked for a glucose meter and when he checked my blood sugar his jaw dropped my sugar was around 900 she looked around everyone in the room and immediately started asking them to get an ambulance on the way right now he told my grandma that he didn\u2019t know how I was still conscious The ambulance arrived and it took me an hour away to a children\u2019s hospital where I was put in the PICU for seven days it was really hard I had a lot to learn about how my life is about to change I had to have help with almost everything walking and going to the bathroom eating etc. after seven days I got to go home and I\u2019ve been doing great ever since I was dying on a cellular level and not one person cared up until it was almost to late I just want to say please take you kids seriously they know when something is wrong.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> [removed]<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> This is so similar to my story, that it made me tear up.

Typically I get three solid days out of a site.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> The reason you need to change your site every 2-3 days is because scar tissue starts to become a major issue if you regularly don\u2019t rotate sites. Nobody is forcing you to change sites more often, but eventually you will see random absorption issues where your insulin isn\u2019t working as fast as it should. \n\nBTW, your pump also logs how often you change sites and reservoirs. When your Endo pulls the report, it is a pretty prominent number... Some endos won\u2019t care, but don\u2019t be surprised if you get asked about it at an upcoming visit.<br><br>\n"}

Especially my time out of range. I have an appointment in a month, im expecting my a1c to be around a 7, which for some people is a huge goal, and mine was touching almost 10 at one point, so im happy with a 7, would be happier with UNDER a 7, but I\u2019ll take what i can get. But now that I\u2019ve touched 5.8 ONCE, my endo expects more of me. Im in my early 20s, female, hormones fluctuate every day, sometimes it just doesn\u2019t work out in my favor. On MDI, dont want the \u201cyou should get a pump\u201d lecture from her, but i know im gona get it. My appointment is in a little over a month, if anyone has any tips to bring my a1c down, even just .1, let me know. I cook 95% of my meals, they\u2019re all fairly low carb, i try to stay active,& i take insulin when i should, dexcom settings 80-150. Im assuming I\u2019ve just had bad luck the past few months, but any tips at all, even for just the slightest drop, would be appreciated. Trying to stay easy on myself, but being lectured by my non t1 endo to \u201cdo better\u201d is honestly the worst part of this whole thing& i am NOT looking forward to it.

Last time I was told to raise it because the a1c being low was due to having os many hypos. I am not going on pump either and won't use libre due to false alarming and inaccurate readings.\n\nI know in raising my a1c I stopped prebolus ing as far in advance, from 20 mins to 5. So that's the first thing I can work on. Could you do this? I doubt it would show up so soon though. \n\nBut other than thst my bg has been massively out of range with huge unpredictability over the last few weeks, the insulin doesn't seem to be working and is taking absolutely ages to work even with high activity.I reordered new pens in case the ones I have are not as effective (??), \n\nIts a marathon not a sprint tho, this is lifelong and the last 6 weeks are a drop in a big ocean. Ultimately this conversation probably won't yield me anything much i dont know lol so it's not that relevant whether I get told off or not.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Time for some boundaries with your endo.\n\nA couple of key points:\n\n1. They work FOR YOU. You DO NOT work for them.\n\n2. You can fire them when they stop working for you.\n\n3. You can tell them \"I will discuss with you getting a pump WHEN AND IF I decide it's best for me.\n\n4. I am an adult and I will not be lectured like I am a child.\n\n5. When they decide they know more than you, start pushing for a pump again, or do anything else to violate your boundaries, tell them \"okay, we're done here\", get up, walk out of the office, and find a new endo. \n\nI've been diabetic for 21 years and have fired more doctors than I can to think about. It's scary the first time but, I promise, it's also very empowering.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> MDI for 35 years, pumps are no interest to me. A low a1c is not a good gauge of control (I have had an a1c of 7.1 with a 90% time in range). Do what WORKS for you, mentally and physically. It might be worth mentioning to your endo that you are working hard to keep your numbers where they are, and are happy with them not being worse. If they mention pumps, just be overly blunt and cut them off with \u201cthat is not for me\u201d. You are doing your best, keep doing that, everything else will come so long as your trying, it just sometimes takes longer than expected.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Endos wanna pretend there\u2019s a cute little algebra equation that we use every single day that hits every single time when we know it literally almost never works that way. They think this disease is some cookie cutter shit and it\u2019s definitely nothing close to just some simple math. I ate peanut butter before bed once and was high all night. My endo asked me if I covered for the peanut butter and I said I sure as shit did. *cue pikachu shocked face*. The math didn\u2019t math so she thought it was best to change ALL my ratios for all the time because it didn\u2019t make sense to her!! GTFO. I told her I wasn\u2019t doing that, told her what prescriptions I needed refilled, and told her I MIGHT try one of her suggestions that came from whatever magic fake ass diabetes calculator she uses. I consulted my magic 8 ball later - I was better off that way.\n\nI didn\u2019t quite say I dose myself based off ~ViBeS~ last time I went in, but I did say I relied a lot on how I felt, and most days I feel different than I did the day before. Even with a good amount of routine, I still have a busy life and shits always changing, like you said. Whatever worked yesterday ain\u2019t gonna cut it today, but might work almost too well tomorrow. I got that good ol pump recommendation too (I used one for 13 years - I\u2019m good on all that) and told her so. Got the \u201coH aRe U sUrE it can do x, y, z and a buncha other things you already know!!\u201d I just told her no and said it would be fat chance in hell since my insurance hardly covers my CGMs. The insurance excuse got her off that topic real quick, hopefully your endo will hop off if you end up having to pull the \u201cinsurance hates diabetics\u201d card too.\n\nRemember, \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d are complete sentences - especially when you get asked the BS passive aggressive questions like \u201cdo you think what you\u2019re doing is working for you even though your A1c is 7.2?\u201d And \u201cwanna get a pump because it might lower that 7.2 a1c?\u201d Yes I do, and no I don\u2019t, next please. \n\nYou got this dude! You know you more than anyone, and endos are really only here to help us get the supplies we need to keep doing what we know works best for us! Good luck :)<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> I count myself unbelievably lucky that my Endo has been positive and supportive so far instead of acting like a scolding nanny.
