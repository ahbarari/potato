I adjust my long acting dose. \n\nI also had irregular periods, but I switched to an IUD, which basically got rid of my period.  I have maybe 1 or 2 days of spotting a month. That has helped tremendously!\n\nI think there are other birth controls that will help make your cycle more regular, too.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Mine tend to run high during my time of the month<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Usually for about 4 days before my period I had high BGs, was moody, craving carbs, sweets and salty snacks, then my period would start and my BGs would plummet and I would crash!  I had been started on an insulin pump and got help creating a special basal rate just for the premenstrual time.  I had to keep track and remember but once I turned it on, it helped with my numbers.  Not sure what to do with the irregularity tho\u2026makes it hard to predict but perhaps if your numbers start creeping upward for no apparent reason that is your cue?<br><br>\n"}

I\u2019ve been doing research here and there and see overall great results, mixed with nausea and some bad lows. \n\nHas anyone had success starting one of these drugs and avoiding lows? I\u2019ve seen people mention a total daily insulin reduction of 25%-50%. Maybe I reduce basal down 25 or 50% from the get go and see how much the GLP-1 drug contributes and increase insulin from there if needed? \n\nAny input is much appreciated!</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> I\u2019ve tried both, no issues with lows. I have a tslim and it will just reduce my basal if needed.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Took 4th dose of 0.25mg today. Was on Lantus + Apidra earlier. Take 0.25mg Ozempic weekly, plus 18U Lantus daily + 2-4 units Apidra if BS spikes over 250.   \nPrior to Ozempic, my BS was wild stayed above 250 usually and will get 3-4 hypos in a day if increased either basal or bolus. Before breakfast I would wake up with BS around 130 and upon walking up to freshen up, before doing anything (like within 15 minutes getting out of bed) eating anything BS would spike to 180... ON FASTING STOMACH. It does not happen anymore \\~ high BS spikes are much controlled. Response to short acting insulin is much better. But I get a daily hypo around 6-7 AM if I am not hyper-vigilant. Sucks. Usually I wake up at 9-10 am not before that. But cant afford rn.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I am a T1 who has been on Saxenda for about 2 months. I use O5 and G6. I have had 2 bad lows in this entire time, and honestly, think that the second one came about as a result of alcohol. I was at a music festival at an all inclusive resort with friends who drink a lot and honestly having 2 drinks a day along with edibles over the course of 4 days, by the last night, I had a horrific low that wasn't even registering on G6 and I had to administer glucagon. I do not think that it was my medication, more that blip in my lifestyle radar. (In my normal life, I have like 2 drinks a week, maybe.) When I got home, I told my endo and she had me change some settings in manual mode, but since then, I haven't had any lows. \n\nI saw my endo and my A1C decreased from 7.1 to 6.6, my TIR is absurd, like 90%, and I have lost about 15 pounds. This is only 2 months in. I did have side effects in the beginning, head aches, queasiness, I vomited twice mostly due to eating too close to bed time (your stomach empties slower), but overall, it's a pretty big help. \n\nI think about it this way. In normies (without obesity, but with a pancreas), there is an organ that secretes all of these hormones to keep us in check. There aren't ONLY (insulin secreting) beta cells in your pancreas, there are 5 cell types that secrete a whole bunch of hormones -glucagon, insulin, somatostatin, ghrelin, and pancreatic polypeptide. For us, our pancreas is destroyed, but by only taking insulin, we are only replacing that one hormone and not the other hormones that have also been taken out as a result of the autoimmune process. \n\nMy endo also had me not go up to the highest dose, which would have been my next step. I am currently at 2.4 mg daily. It is still working well. \n\nGood luck, and hope you don't have any issues finding your med! It's a problem and whatever you do, DO NOT USE COMPOUNDED PRODUCT. Use only the innovator product in pens.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> I kept my basal the same and split bolus for meals, that way I can increase/decrease on the second half as needed. Haven't had any problems. Overall lowered my bolus intake probably 30-40%.<br><br>\n"}

Or maybe you missed your basal injection? Maybe your insulin has gone off. I'd start with changing your insulin if possible. If you have missed the basal insulin, you will need significantly more insulin to remain stable, do that until your next scheduled basal injection, don't double up basal if you are not sure whether you took it or not.\n\nIf you are ill you will likely need more insulin to remain in range aswell.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> It sounds like maybe basal is off?

It wouldn't be reasonable for someone else to tell you how to dose, partly because dosing is so individual and mainly because sliding scale is an older, not-as-effective way of managing blood sugar.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> There is no way that someone else can tell you how much insulin to take - we are all different. You really do need to call your doctor. If all you have is a sliding scale, you might want to look for a new doctor, too - that's not a very modern or effective way to manage type 1.<br><br>\n"}
