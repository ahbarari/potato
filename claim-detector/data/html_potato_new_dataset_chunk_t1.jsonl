Just half a year ago I moved away from my family and I live on my own in a rented apartment. I have diabetes for almost 11 years now but I find it increasingly difficult to manage it. Despite the fact that I'm doing literally everything I've been told by my doctor I cannot seem to cope with hyperglycemias. It's more frustrating now since I have important exams that will determine if I'll pass or not. I cannot concentrate, I'm restless even if I sleep longer than I should and learning anything is nearly impossible. I cannot even do the simplest tasks and it's also taking a great toll on my job. Is there anything I can possibly do to somehow supress hyperglycemias effectively in a short period of time? How do you deal with them? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> brisk walk does magic \ud83c\udfa9<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Is there a pattern? Does the hyperglycemia occur at consistent times, for example after meals or overnight? If it is a regular, recurring thing, it might just mean that you need more insulin at those times. Do you adjust your doses on your own or wait for your doctor to do it? Does it happen when you are stressed at school, such as before an exam? That can be a little harder to control but if it's very consistent (happening every time you have an exam or presentation or whatever) then taking a bit of extra insulin then might also help until you get more used to the new activities and are less stressed by them. As someone else mentioned, a quick walk can also get the insulin working better.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Either exercise, get insulin, or drink water. I also eat snow sometimes.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Might seem totally unrelated but the \u201cfight/flight\u201d response kicks in automatically. Over the years it\u2019s easily increased stress levels and subsequent cortisol levels that also affect BG. Breathing and grounding helps me. Doesn\u2019t necessarily have a direct impact and I know only a bit of the physiology, however has helped with the balance a whole lot.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Highs are usually caused by too low basal dose, too low bolus dose, illness, stress and many other unknown factors. Fix one or more for better control.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Eating less/lower carbohydrates has done wonders for me<br><br>\n"}

I used to have bad sleep apnea and i think my body was releasing cortisol, sending my blood sugar straight up<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Because your liver releases glucose at night while you sleep it happens to everyone even non diabetics but their pancreas works so it combats it to stays at a normal blood sugar. The only way you can control this as a diabetic is to have a insulin pump. Apparently their is another before bed shot you can take on top of your basil but my endo says it sucks. The pump is basically the most reliable healthy way to prevent this night time glucose rise.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Probably need to adjust your basil.

If you take it on a morning you're possibly \"running out\" overnight. \n\nI take Lantus just before bed and in the last fortnight I've had to reduce by 8 units because of overnight lows, despite running high for months I've suddenly started to have lows.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Get a pump<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> You need to up your basal dosage.

I will often go for a walk or do some light exercise shortly after eating and the difference in my post meal spikes between I do it vs when I don't is significant.\n\nI also sometimes [super bolus](https://www.diabetesnet.com/diabetes-technology/blue-skying/super-bolus/), which is where you add your next couple of hours worth of basal insulin on to your bolus and then do a 0% temp rate on your basal for that time. That's helpful when I know the food will spike me quickly.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> It\u2019s possible 15 minutes isn\u2019t enough of a prebolus. You could try increasing it by a minute or two and seeing if your spike height changes. \n\nI\u2019m on Lyumjev, one of the fastest insulins on the market and I need to give it a 25 minute prebolus to keep my spike down.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I\u2019d add five more minutes to the prebolus. Mine takes close to 25 minutes.  You can also over-bolus and back off your basal later, but I haven\u2019t gotten to try that yet because I\u2019m MDI.\n\nI also stuck a water bottle next to my pens and I drink water when I take the insulin. It has helped my prebolus time.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Eat less during meals but have small snacks between meals.\n\nAnother useful thing to do is to manage basal(s). I use different basal rates for different activities e.g., sleep, sedentary day, and varying levels of physical activity.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Sometimes 15 minutes isn\u2019t enough time depending on what you eat! For fatty meals I barely pre-bolus while stuff like cookies/cake I have to wait like 30-40 minutes before eating cause it hits me super fast. Try waiting a little longer and see if that helps. If not, perhaps your ratio isn\u2019t quite dialed in. Keep in mind it\u2019s not uncommon for your ratio to change throughout the day. Mine is wack in the mornings, lower in the afternoons and pretty normal in the evenings.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Depending on which way you blood is going I find a short walk after eating helps get the insulin working. If your trending down it will lead to a low. If I take insulin and eat with no exercise my blood goes high no matter what I take<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> I use 45 minutes to treat before eating carbs. 15 minutes for protein. Honestly was surprised how well it worked when it was suggested.<br><br>\n"}

I\u2019ve had it for 2 weeks and have already had 2 get ripped off from either a corner of a wall or the dining room table. Is there a product that hold it on better? Is something to put under a patch to make it more rigid and durable. I will start using a patch more but it don\u2019t seem secure enough.\n\nAlso how do you guys sleep with it on your stomach? It\u2019s so annoying. Is that something I will eventually get use to?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> It\u2019s part of why I quit the omnipod. It\u2019s just SO massive.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> I keep it on my lower back actually so sleeping on my stomach is no problem at all. Maybe try some other places you can put the pod to see what works better for you?<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Sleeping you\u2019ll get used to! It takes time but eventually you\u2019ll be able to ignore that part.\n\nAs for hitting it on stuff, try angling your pod differently. If mines on my stomach, I like to have it horizontal or sometimes I\u2019ll go diagonal up or down but far away from my love handles. Arm is tricky sometimes (I accidentally pulled mine off when taking my bra off once \ud83d\ude02) and thigh I just don\u2019t like. Back I\u2019ve never had an issue. You\u2019ll get the hang of it and eventually you won\u2019t hit it all the time!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> There\u2019s not much you can do to keep it on if you catch it and rip it off. But it does happen less eventually. When I started (12ish years ago) I would hit it all the time. On my arm, it was doorframes, and on my leg, it was\u2026 everything. The worst was ripping it clean off on a school bus seat. Over time I got used to it and now I hardly ever hit it, and when I do it\u2019s just slightly.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> I bought bands that I use while sleeping for my arms because I'm a restless sleepers that covers that pod( almost similar to stretchy under armor but slightly tighter) or I'll use Vet wrap if desperate. I have actually had luck with using my chest  as a site lol apparently boobage absorbs insulin well for me.  As always SkinTac and Simpatch never seem to let me down and I usually have trouble pulling pod off after using SkinTac. Amazon sells different \"belts, arms bands etc for runners that I've used in past that have been helpful.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> We use [Pod Pals](https://sugarmedical.com/products/pod-pals-omnipod-adhesive-overlays) to help keep them on.

Usually you should be able to go to a diabetes centre to receive proper and thorough education about how to handle your diabetes. More than anyone here could provide.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Usually a medical professional helps you figure out what your carb to insulin ratio is, and then you would just do the math to figure out how much insulin you need. \n\nPrebolusing just means to take your insulin and wait a period of time before you eat. The amount of time that works best varies, I find about 20 minutes before eating is ideal.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Contact your medical personnel about this!! But I\u2019ll say that if you have lows at night it might indicate that the Tresiba dose is too high.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> In addition to the above, if your Endocrinologist hasn\u2019t reviewed this with you then I\u2019d strongly recommend looking for a new Endo. You\u2019re new to this and they should\u2019ve ensured you have the basic down when they put you on these prescriptions. Glad you came here for support.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> You might benefit from Juicebox podcast \"pro series.\"\n\nThis does not replace seeking guidance from your endocrinology clinic team.  More like homework or self-study, so you can really maximize what you learn from your team.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Carb counting is done by reading the labels, looking up carb counts on the internet, with an app, or in a book. So if you eat a piece of steak and a cup of broccoli you look it up and learn that the steak has no carbs and the broccoli has the amount your app or book says. You will memorize many foods over time. Next you have to dose for any carbs you\u2019re gonna eat. For every certain amount of carbs you will need a certain amount of insulin. That\u2019s called a carb ratio and with some math you can calculate how much insulin you need at each meal. Except that your carb ratio might be different at different times of the day and you may need to add more insulin if you are high. Yes, it\u2019s complicated but you will get it in time. If you are going low at night you probably have too much Tresiba. There are exceptions. Wake up at 12 and three to treat lows unless you have an odd bedtime or you wake to CGM alarms. A prebolus means you are dosing for food before you eat. You might dose five minutes to forty five min before depending on how high you are and how fast the food will be, etc. Only do this later when you know more. Did your doctor tell you to eat according to a meal plan where every meal is already set? If yes, just follow that plan until told otherwise. Don\u2019t dose before bed unless you wont sleep through a low.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> Pretty recently diagnosed here..\nMy endo told me to inject 1 unit of bolus (in my case apidra) for every 10 g of carbs. And for the random spikes during the day (without eating anything) is to inject 1-1.5 units for every 2 mmol/l to the normal level (e.g. if my sugar level is 11 mmol/l and I want to lower it to 5 mmol/l I have to inject 3-4 units)\nRequires some math, but pretty accurate for me (so far))<br><br>\n"}

Same with hot tubs. Things to keep in mind are that heat and sweating often increases insulin sensitivity, so your insulin may be more effective than usual which could cause lows.

And I do aim for around 150 (do you have a CGM? 150 and steady is very different from 150 and rapidly falling).\n\nWe usually start right after my work, making it a bit hard to squeeze in dinner before, thus I very often miss the 150. But anything under 110 and they're gonna have to start without me.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> The type of exercise really affects me differently. Cardio and I'll drop like a rock. Weights and I'll go higher. With my pump (medtronic) I set a temp basal and it'll try to hold me at 150. Does he have a pump and/ or a CGM?<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> What is mtb training?<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> If you have insulin in your system, that will have more of an effect. If I exercise on an empty stomach first with zero insulin on board, effects on my BG are negligible. If I just had dinner and lots of insulin in me, BG will plummet. \n\nJust FYI.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Does he cycle to the top or get a lift and let gravity do its things on his way back down? The reason I ask is I do hill walking quite a lot. During the ascent I have to reduce my insulin by 50%-75% before I start or my bloods will plummet. However as I reach the top I resume my insulin as on my decent, there isn't much physical effort in comparison to the ascent and my bloods will shoot up otherwise.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Just let him be at 180. For me exercise tends to go similar. And then once I\u2019m relaxing after training I crash down hard. A few hours at 180 won\u2019t harm him or anything.

If you are already under that the iLet would be worst<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> The iLet is really designed for people who don't want to think about their diabetes or don't/can't manage it well and just want something to work for them \n\nIt's a good pump, but will cause havoc for the more advanced and well managed users.\n\nIf you go low you have to be super careful how much you treat, and if you're running high you're SOL and have to wait till the pump gives you enough insulin to get you back to target<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Your Endo is correct in that it's GREAT for people who are at an A1C of 14 (fully unwilling to manage their diabetes) and can help bring them down to around a 7. For those who have tight control it would be a nightmare. I listened to an interview with the founder on The Juice box and he stated that \"post meal of up to 270 was acceptable to their algorithm\". I'm sorry, but if I'm at 205 I'm already range bolusing. If I'm over 220 or so I feel like death. I can't imagine being stuck at 250+ without the ability to bolus down.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> The ilet is an amazing option for people who are burnt out and have dangerously high a1cs, children and teens who have very little parental support, people in a clinical setting (like a nursing home) who have subpar support from staff, people who have disordered eating whose issues are exacerbated by carb counting, and people with cognitive disabilities.\n\nHere is an interview with the creater\nhttps://www.juiceboxpodcast.com/episodes/jbp934\n\nI think it will save countless lives for people who can no longer care for themselves (due to burnout or disability or lack of education on how to manage diabetes)\n\nIt's not a great fit for someone who needs tight control (a pregnant T1D, someone who has late stage kidney failure), someone on a very low carb diet, or someone who prefers very tight control.\n\nMy son has multiple disabilities (he's autistic with an intellectual disability) and we plan on switching to the ilet as he grows older, but for now he's pretty young and living at home so we have very good control on the OP5, and are happy with our current routine. We are not looking to switch anytime soon.\n\nI'm really excited about the research that iLet is doing with a dual pump (that has both insulin and glucagon) but that's several years away from commercial use.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> Everyone else's comment is completely on point, I just wanted to add another one that I think the ILet for you would be a big NO. Don't be afraid to assert yourself with your endo!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> NO!!!!! Control IQ is a far superior algorithm to the iLet. The iLet has no way to adjust basal rates or give correction boluses. You just have to wait for the algorithm to figure it out. \n\nIt averages maintaining an A1c of around 7, but many, many people hit 5s on the Tandem, which is basically a non-diabetic A1c.<br><br>\n"}

There is an issue with an older version of the pump software that makes it think the battery is empty and it acts accordingly.

Try connecting your pump to your computer and doing a software update (especially if you can't remember when you last updated - they have created a fix in the last 6 months or so).

You might even notice on some runs the adrenaline will increase your blood sugar.

Like everything else - it's harder for us than the average person. Good luck!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> I\u2019ve never found exercise mode to be useful for cardio because the autoboluses for a rising blood sugar cause me to crash hard. I actually use sleep mode instead when exercising and it\u2019s great because it doesn\u2019t give the autoboluses. Regardless, I also have about 15g of sugar 15 minutes before exercising and another 15g every half hour or so if I\u2019m doing a long run and I\u2019ll stay pretty stable \u2014 it\u2019ll be different for everyone but that\u2019s what I\u2019ve found to work for me.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> I LOVE my tandem... except when it comes to exercise. If I\u2019m doing intense cardio, I crash really hard really fast. When I first got type one, I would have to be at 250-300 in order to exercise and not crash. My old pump had a setting where you could lower your basal rate by whatever percentage before exercising. That works perfect because I would just take 50% for the hour before. That way I wouldn\u2019t climb too high before or crash during. Because tandem has the control IQ, it automatically corrects me when I\u2019m trying to raise my blood sugar before exercising. It\u2019s super frustrating. I have to turn it off for at least a half hour before exercising. The Exercise Activity setting is useless. I have figured out that breaking my exercise into smaller chunks, like two brisk 30 minute walks a day, is much better- or I will under dose a meal and exercise right after. If I want to do a full hour of cardio, then I usually turn off my pump for 30 minutes before I don\u2019t restart it until 30 to 45 minutes into exercising. I\u2019m not sure which is better- The ups and downs your blood sugar goes through when exercising, or just doing gentle forms of exercise that don\u2019t change your blood sugar but don\u2019t always help with your cardiovascular health.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> For me, it really depends on how much insulin on board I have. Running increases seems to at least double my insulin sensitivity. I try to aim for 1 unit or less of IOB before I start. If I am high before, I only take half my normal correction.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> Running especially would tank me. What finally worked for me was lowering my basal by 50% about 30 mins before the run and down to 30% before heading out the door. If I had any insulin on board, I would have a light snack (a clementine and some pb for example). I also made sure I had some glucose gels while on my run. \n\nThere was a lot of trial and error and shorter runs to figure this out. Don\u2019t get discouraged! You can do it. \n\nAlso, control iq isn\u2019t for everyone. I also have a dexcom and tslim. While I love them, I do a better job than control iq (it\u2019s not aggressive enough for me).<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> For me, running in the morning (before breakfast) requires almost no adjustment.  But I can't really do mornings, so in the afternoon, I only run 3 hours after a meal, do a 50 percent basal for 1 hour, and drink a cup of Gatorade right before going out.

I have tea with milk and sugar most mornings. I bolus for foot on the floor before I get out of bed. I bolus for the drink about 30 minutes before drinking it.  If basal is off, I add some back at 15 minutes. And when I start drinking, I start my breakfast pre-bolus to help with the quick impact from the liquid. (I\u2019m also on O5 and it catches the drop really well, but I do tend to leave some fat and protein uncovered at breakfast because I walk my dog after breakfast.)<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Not a pump user, but I usually do half sweet (or no sugar) and a higher fat cream or coconut milk to slow down the hit of the sugar. Then I pair it with a small bolus and a walk. So my local coffee shop does a \"coco moco\" which is a cocoa latte made with coconut milk. I forgo the sugar and give about 2H and enjoy it while walking my alaskan malamute (he also gets treats at the coffee shop so it is a win win).<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> I just do the bus as soon as the drink is on hand.

It genuinely did not matter what I did, I would still end up high hours later. I ended up going back to manual mode because the extended bolus option works so much better for my body!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 9:</b> TBH, I wouldn't drink that. To me it's not worth the hassle to consume sweetened  drinks. But if I were to drink it - and this is my way of doing it because I know how my body reacts, you may be different - if I drank it I'd have a substantial pre bolus, like 20-30 minutes so the insulin is already kicking in. A sugary drink will hit me fast and hard. Without the pre bolus the spike would be uncontrollable...<br><br>\n"}
{"id": "wn05jy", "text": "<div class='post' style='user-select:none;'>\n  <h2>Post</h2>\n  <p>Can I reserve my pancreas?\nMy kid is 7 and is T1. I googled for answers to no avail. I am an organ donor, but I wondered if there\u2019s a way to reserve my pancreas for my son to receive when I die? Just curious how I would even go about it.\n\nWe are the same blood type, btw.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> His pancreas still does some jobs. If he were to receive yours, he would trade T1d for immunosuppressants. Most people don\u2019t find that trade off to be worth it. Usually, the people who get pancreas transplants are already getting something else transplanted, like a liver. Since they will require immunosuppressants anyway, the trade off is worth it.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Pancreas transplants are fairly rare, difficult to pull off, and generally only offer a short term benefit.  The immunosuppressants required are probably worse than controlling T1.  If I remember correctly even those with successful transplants have a 50% chance of being back on insulin at five years.  It's a lovely thought to have your kid get your pancreas but it's not really a solution.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> The average lifespan of a transplanted pancreas is 10 years. The younger he is when he has a transplant, the more likely he will need more than 1.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Pancreas transplants aren't really a viable method of treating diabetes, and is considered a last resort option. Transplants don't last forever, and some don't even last a year. Even if your son got lucky he'd probably only survive a decade or two after getting a transplant. The half life of pancreas transplants is 11 years, meaning in half of patients who have them the transplant fails before 11 years, and half fail after. As far as I can tell, the record for the longest surviving pancreas transplant is 24 years. \n\nType one can be managed for a lifetime, and we're closer and closer to a cure all the time. Your kid has a better chance just living with diabetes and hoping for a cure to be finished than trying to get an unnecessary transplant. I don't want to get your hopes up, but with where we are now it's pretty likely a cure will be possible by the time he is an adult.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Aside from the drawbacks noted by others, you didn't say where you live. It's a bit hard to advise when nobody knows what laws might be applicable in your jurisdiction.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> It\u2019s more than just immunosuppressive issues. His pancreas is perfectly fine. T1D isn\u2019t a pancreas issue, it\u2019s and antibody issue. His body is literally attacking the beta cells in the pancreas, causing the pancreas to have issues. He won\u2019t lose the antibodies he has because there was an organ donor. People don\u2019t really do transplants because it\u2019s highly likely the body will eventually attack the new pancreas. There has to be some sort of antibody treatment and immunosuppressive along with the transplant. \n\nMost the new trials for pancreas treatment are actually trying to find a way to make the antibodies mission of killing the pancreas unsuccessful. When doing so the pancreas should go back to normal and beta cells will work again.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> Immunosupressants will be needed. I am not a medical professional but your kid's immune system might think that your pancreas is also a threat so the trade off is not worth it. If they are doing fine without it, then don't let them have the misfortune of a very weak immune system that can cause more issues.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> I would strongly advise against pancreatic dontations as a treatment for T1D unless a doctor recommends it for two specific reasons:\n\nOrgan transplantation is a serious surgery generally considered a last resort for people with major complications or severely brittle diabetes with complications. This is because receiving an organ through transplanting then requires the receiver to take immunoupressants for life to prevent rejection. This puts them at risk for any number of infections and other medical problems.\n\nTransplantation also does not gaurantee their immune system won't once again attack and destory the islet cells that make insulin. In many cases, a new pancreas only \"cures\" someone from needing injected insulin for a short period of time.\n\nI woukd recommend talking to your doctor about this option. It's unfortunately not the miracle cure it is sometimes believed to be, absent an emergency situation.<br><br>\n"}

Try avoid getting to the point where your body reacts (my sons is around 3.8mmol/L) otherwise you will go high pretty quickly.

{"id": "jszztc", "text": "<div class='post' style='user-select:none;'>\n  <h2>Post</h2>\n  <p>How do I properly take insulin for vegetables and protein?\nHello all, hope everyone's well. UK resident here and I would like to hopefully get some help from friends on this sub.\n\nRecently I've decided I want to start eating healthy, had a bit of a spell of eating so many bags of crisps and choccy bars lol. I have started replacing carb heavy meals (more than 60g carbs) with low carb alternatives so for example for tea today I ate.\n\n- 80g Brussel sprouts\n- 80g Carrots\n- 80g Broccoli\n- 80g cauliflower\n- 200g chicken\n\nNow the carbohydrates of this meal added up to around 15g carbs. I also add mint sauce and mix it in for flavour so that is like an extra 5-10g carbs.\n\nSo for this meal I take 3 units of Novo-rapid insulin. I have this meal a few times per week however I always notice that my blood sugar levels will rise from around 5.6mmol/L(100.8Mg/dl) to 12(216Mg/dl), about 3 hours later, needing me to take a correction. (Estimation but it always rises a bit)\n\nI've looked at the carb content time and time again and meticiously measured them and they are bang on. I know my insulin sensitivity is ok because when I eat porridge for breakfast my blood sugar goes fine.\n\nSo I guess my question is, is there a way to Protein count in diet? Similar to the way we carb count, as I imagine it's the chickens fault? As well as the veg which I think contain protein too.\n\n\nThanks all.\nDan</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Trial and error basically. If 3 units raises it, then try 4.5 or 5.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Hey Dan, fellow UK based T1D here. Are you on a pump? Before I got my pump, my Dr (who works alongside Dr Bernstein and is a massive fan of low carb for t1d) put me on a 'slower acting' insulin just to take for high protein, low carb meals. IIRC it was pig insulin! If I have a lower carb meal now, I take an extended bolus that stops the spike but doesn't cause me to go low.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I had a similar problem to you when i also started low carb (blood sugar rising 3 hours later) and am also currently on novorapid. My workaround at the moment is to give myself some units 1p minutes before i start eating (usually 2 to 4) and then some more units 2 hours later to account for the protein (also usually 2 units, but depends on how much protein i ate.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> The Type one diabetes Juicebox podcast has some of the best information on this and so much more! Man, what a difference it has made! Night and day! A 5.5 A1C down from 7.9 that confused the Endo!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Hello! I eat low carb. I bolus for carbs and veggies up front, then I bolus about 2 hours later for the protein. Trial and error, honestly. And different types of protein will raise you differently so it will take practice but generally the protein rise comes 2-3 hours after a meal so you\u2019ll need to plan for it then.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> I use regular Insulin and a bit fast acting insulin to cover protein and low-carb meals.<br><br>\n"}
{"id": "1011cmq", "text": "<div class='post' style='user-select:none;'>\n  <h2>Post</h2>\n  <p>How do I drink safely?\nIm 16 years old, I was diagnosed with T1D back in June, so about 6 months ago. I have never drank before but I would like to be able to drink with my friends. I understand that drinking can be very dangerous. I have a cgm and a pump and I am using the loop app to manage BG. I read that hard liquor can lower blood sugars, how does that work? Can I get around this by just lowering my basal and not worrying about it? How do I drink safely with T1D?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> (Assuming 16 is the legal drinking age in your country)\n\neat a meal before you start drinking, preferably with a glass of water. \n\nknow what a serving of alcohol is no matter the type of alcohol,\n\nno more than 1 serving of alcohol per hour,\n\nalways have a designated driver, I also make sure people know to call 911 if I can't be woken they are not allowed to use my insulin on me.\n\nI drink sugary mixed drinks because I find that drinking lowers my blood sugar enough that my sugary mixed drinks keep me up, but I have to keep something next to the bed, because I usually go low before I wake up the next day. The only way to know how alcohol affects you personally is to keep your CGM close at all times.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> When your liver is processing alcohol, it will stop releasing glucose. If you still have basal insulin running at the normal rate, than your blood sugar will drop. There are different strategies for handling this. Lowering your basal rate and/or having a closed loop system do it for you is helpful. Make sure to never drink on an empty stomach. Be mindful that some alcoholic drinks have a lot of sugar and you may not need to bolus as much as you would for a nonalcoholic version of that same drink. Basically, a lot of trial and error. Keep an eye on your blood sugar.  And drink plenty of water. Cheers!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> At your age: make sure your parents are OK with it. Seriously. Because if it goes wrong - and at some stage, it will - they need to know what's been going on and not be guessing. Trust me on this. It may have saved my life when I was 17 and stupid.\n\nHave food on board. Don't be alone. Try, if you can, to avoid drinking to excess. Experiment, slowly. I don't mean outrageous mixes, I mean:\n\n* 1 beer on its own, no insulin does: this.\n* 1 beer, 1 unit just as I drink it does: this.\n* 1 shot, on its own, no insulin, does: this\n\nAnd so on. It's a little hit or miss. But you'll build your own little library of alcohol affects you. There are generalizations of how alcohol affects T1s. They are generalizations, not universal truths. Hard liquor with no mixers doesn't affect me, nor does white wine. Beer does, and the hoppier/darker it is, the more it does. Insulin required, and no, it doesn't drop me afterwards.\n\nIf your parents are cool with it, do the experiment and note taking with them present; that might help them trust you a bit more. If they're not, find your most responsible trustworthy friend and do it with him. Have glucose and insulin nearby and make sure he or she knows the difference.\n\nAt some point you're going to fuck up. Practice your apology speech now.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> It\u2019s not that dangerous, you have a CGM. People here seem to forget diabetes and drinking has been around a hell of a lot longer than CGMs have. I highly disagree with bringing other people into the fold beyond \u201chey I\u2019m diabetic, if I ask for sugar bring me sugar\u201d but to each their own. \n\nDon\u2019t do straight liquor or hunch punch that some dude made for the party. No one that age can pace themselves and it goes off the rails very easily. Beer is awesome. \n\nDon\u2019t take insulin for any drinks you have. Have low sugar snacks on hand. \n\nIt\u2019s always better to be slightly high than it is to be super low while drinking. Give yourself a buffer. You can always take insulin if you\u2019re running high towards the end of the night. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to handle it, folks go way overboard with this, it\u2019s not that complicated. You don\u2019t need insulin for drinks unless you\u2019re smashing a bunch of sugary alcoholic drinks, which, don\u2019t do that. Jack and regular coke? Don\u2019t. Orange juice and vodka? Don\u2019t. Have low supplies and play it safe with a buffer. Easy.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> https://www.jdrf.org/t1d-resources/living-with-t1d/food-and-diet/diabetes-and-alcohol/<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> I don't personally drink, but I have been told that if I were to, to have a sober friend who is willing to keep an eye on me for the night, willing and able to wake me up if I were to have a hypo during the night<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 7:</b> Please ignore the blanket advice of \"your body will do this\", \"your body will do that\". \n\nThere is ZERO guarantee that you will respond in the predictable manner.\n\nFor instance, I go high and stay high with alcohol, no matter the type. A shot of straight vodka has the same effect for me as a regular soda. But it lasts longer\n\nThe only safer way to drink is start slow, in the safety of your own home, with both high and low supplies and preferably either on your own or with a friend or two.\n\nThe more calm and alert you are to your diabetes while drinking, for the first time, the better. \n\nFinding out how you'll respond at a raging party is not a good idea. \n\nBut, testing the waters on your own can help you during those parties.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 8:</b> Don't drink for the first time while out with freinds. Do it at home with your parents present until you learned how  your body handle alchohol and drinks of different sugar and carb levels.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 9:</b> When I first started drinking (and continuing drinking all night) I used to drink one alcoholic drink, and then a pint of water. I alternated between booze and water until I got older and more experienced with booze.\n\nI would definitely recommend this for anyone, for a number of reasons. 1. You\u2019ll fill up with liquid faster so physically won\u2019t be able to drink as much (good for learning how much alcohol your body can handle, and acclimating your body to alcohol). 2. You\u2019ll be that one annoying prick in the morning who wakes up after a night out with no hangover \ud83d\ude02\n\nI\u2019ve learnt over the years that shots, spirits, liquor, just don\u2019t do my body any favours. This isn\u2019t diabetes related, just me not being able to stomach strong alcohol.\n\nThe advice about sticking to beer is good, as it can be gassy, and fills you up quicker, so you physically can\u2019t drink as much alcohol. Same sort of deal as the drinking water in between.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 10:</b> I measured how many milliliters are in my average mouthful. For me 1 gulp is about 50 mL and a sip is about 25 mL. I took different sized mouthfuls of water and spat them into a bowl on my food scale. Did that enough times to find my average. \nWhen I drink i know how much carbs are per 100mL and the math is pretty simple, just need to keep track of how many sips/gulps u take. I have a scoreboard of how much i drank in my head that i can visualize.\n\nThis is also a good hack for if you need to correct a low with a beverage and you dont have any measuring cups\u203c\ufe0f\n\nWith beer and hard cider i bolus per usual. With hard alcohol i always eat something with it and bolus around 70% of what i usually would(for carbs in food and alcohol combined) For wine i bolus for 25% of the carbs but dont need to eat while drinkinkg (although i usually am lol).\n\nI always eat a handful of nuts and chocolate chips before going to bed after drinking bc its a good fat:carb:protein ratio for me<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 11:</b> I was diagnosed at 16, 20 yrs ago. I felt the need to feel *normal* and do normal teen stuff. You can have fun, but please utilize your CGM and don't feed the urge to keep pushing things. I drank in college too, and sometimes I wonder how I didn't die. Drinking too much can spike your sugars like crazy, and then while you're hungover drop like crazy, and when you feeling like dog turds after having a few too many, it's harder to stay on top of actually taking care of yourself, it's not worth it. I wish I could tell my younger self to cool it drinking heavily with peers, having fun and imbibing is not a competition, enjoy your time with friends without thinking you need to drink *all* the drinks. If cannabis is kind to you, it's more fun blazing instead of tying too many on, you won't lose your wits/senses like you will with alcohol. Having fun and exploring is a part of growing up, but please be kind to yourself and please take advantage of the info your CGM provides in this time of discovery. Be safe and trust your common sense!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 12:</b> Assume that you need less insulin when you have been drinking. Especially is you're out dancing, you might not need to correct for highs. \n\nDon't drink on an empty stomach. \n\nAlways carry glucose tablets and snacks. \n\nEducate your friends what to do in case you get too low. \n\nAlways eat something (perhaps even without bolusing) before you sleep.<br><br>\n"}
