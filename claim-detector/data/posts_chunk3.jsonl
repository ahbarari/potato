Adding the text here as it didn't show up. \ud83d\ude0a\n___________________\n\nHello! \nRecently I've noticed that my bg almost always drop during the night. I take my Lantus at 11 at night, go to sleep at midnight. Then, around 5 or 6 in the morning, I get a low notification and have to go up and have half a glass of juice and half a sandwich. That usually keeps me ok (rise to about 6mmol) until it's time to go up at 9. Sometimes I drop once more and have to eat again at 8. \n\nEven if I go to sleep at 7-8-9-10 mmol I'll still drop. I HATE waking up to alarms during the night!\n\nI figured my Lantus kicks in too hard and too soon when I take it, so I'd like to take my Lantus in the morning instead. But how do I change that? Split the dose one night, then it's fine to go the next day? Any tips from someone that has changed the timing? \u2764\ufe0f\n\n(Yes, I can call my team, but I'd rather try fixing this by myself. As long as I feel good I can do what I want.)\n\n\nDiabetes t1 since 2008, f31, mdi, libre2. Latest hba1c 42 (ca 5,8%)<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Well, I faced a similar issue. My bg levels dropped during night, while by evening it started to spike. So I figured that it didn't stay in my body for long. What I did was make it half and half across 12 hours period. Gradually, then I adjusted the dosages (earlier I was taking 10 units at night) and started taking 3u at morning and 5u at night.<br><br>\n"}

Now, if you just don\u2019t want your phone on you for some reason, that\u2019s your choice.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> So the Libre 3 sensor feeds data to your phone continuously, so it doesn\u2019t let you pair multiple devices to it (afaik anyway). The Libre 2 does however let you scan with multiple devices/phones. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to use both phones though - if you\u2019re in the states your phone counts as a medical device, your work has to let you use it.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I do not believe so, and unfortunately they do not allow the Libre 3 to connect with the reader device and the app at the same time.  \n\n\n* https://www.support.freestyle.abbott/hc/en-us/articles/17309393719569-Can-I-interchange-using-the-FreeStyle-Libre-3-reader-and-app-while-wearing-a-FreeStyle-Libre-3-sensor- \n\nThe only workaround I can suggest is having a cheap simple third phone that you carry everywhere and use the LibreLinkUp app on your personal and work phones. That is really cumbersome and probably not what you want.<br><br>\n"}

More info in comments</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> So this is my first day with the dexicom. I\u2019ve had a few drinks tonight some of which were cocktails so high sugar content. Prior to dexicom, I\u2019ve always checked BS before drinking and then I would check before bed, then often in the morning I would be low. I can now see that this trend is very likely to continue at the time of me typing this. \n\nI\u2019ve had no extra insulin, yet for some reason my blood sugar is dropping? Prior to dexicom I only had my snapshot window blood sugar tests, it would show prior to drinking Normal bs, then when I get home, normal bs, and then in the morning I always run low? I take my long term Optisilin (used to be called Lantus) at 7:00 in the morning and this is maybe the only thing I could think that could be causing this? However, during the week where I\u2019ve had no alcohol I don\u2019t run high or run low?? What am I missing???<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> I typically stay away from sugary drinks\u2026.most often light beer.  For probably 15-20 years I was blind to these phenomena as well but I knew be careful when trying to cover alcohol.  \nNow with cgm and tandem I will try to cover alcohol at least early in night\u2026and as the liver begins to shut down sugar I am not covering the drinks.  When I drink excessive amounts I find I get the munchies before passing out.  There have been times where food was eaten and I have no logs showing was covered and blood sugar didn\u2019t rise\u2026.good to have a small snack before bed. I\u2019ve used energy bars for this since they take a while to breakdown into sugar<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Alcohol makes me drop overnight!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Yeah your lantus is peaking.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> I'm skeptical this isn't separate things. Cocktails are not very sugary in most instances, like have you guys made a cocktail ever? Idk what y'all are talking about, that's a major spike. If your idea of a cocktail is whisky and coca cola, then ok lol, you should prob stop that. This really isn't enough data, I think you are not bolusing correctly on your dinner and the alcohol maybe dropped you a bit along with insulin still in your system doing it's thing. But alcohol doesn't usually drop folks 6 hours later, that's not really how it works.   \n\n\n\"I've had no extra insulin\" is a nonsensical statement tho that communicates nothing to help understand what's going on here. But as is, you aren't going low here. There are way too many variables, you aren't nearly specific enough, and you are just getting a feel for it. It takes time, you will develop a much deeper understanding of your body, food, insulin, and diabetes. keep it up!<br><br>\n"}

I'm about to say goodbye on Saturday to my furry Best friend Chelsea. I've had 15 amazing years with her. And now it's sadly time to say goodbye and let her go. She has mammory cancer, chronic pancreatitis, and an intestinal blockage that won't get better without major surgery. But I can't put her through that, there's a high possibility she wouldn't even survive the operation. I've noticed the past week my blood sugar has been pretty elevated staying in the high 200-300 range even with my usual insulin regimen. Has anyone else experienced this in stressful situations? Should I increase my insulin for now? And am I at risk of going dka? Thank you all.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Yes. Stress hormones cause a rise in sugar levels. This is why long term stress is very dangerous.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Yes, stress will elevate blood glucose. You will have to increase your insulin dose to compensate but be prepared for lows when your bg returns to \"normal\" as the stress subsides. If you're on a pump it's much easier to mange because you can raise the basal rate...\n\nLive Long and Prosper<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Sending huge hugs. It makes mine go so high, but that's natural when you're under so much stress. The weeks after I lost a close family member my insulin barely touched me. Be kind to yourself x<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Sending all of my thoughts and big hugs during this difficult time. I found out a few days before Christmas that my sweet girl has bladder cancer (she\u2019s almost 15) and just the devastation from that news and a lot of crying, gave me insulin resistance. In my opinion, I feel that you need to let yourself grieve and be a little relaxed on your blood sugar levels. Looking ahead for when my girl passes, it will be really difficult and I\u2019ll have to be less strict on my diabetes management temporarily just since life will be difficult enough as it is.

I\u2019ve been a diabetic for a little bit over a year now and I need to start giving myself insulin shots, I\u2019m not scared of needles however when the time comes for me to give myself a shot I just can\u2019t do it. I was wondering if there is any advice for being able to give yourself a needle and was also curious about others experiences giving themselves their first needles.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> I was definitely scared of needles to start with. I had to have a friend show me even finger pricks before I would try it. \n\nIt's terrifying, it's nerve wracking, and in the end, the anticipation and worrying is ABSOLUTELY so much worse than the actual needle. I did needles for about a year before switching to a pump, and maybe 1 in 10 actually \"hurt,\" approximately as bad as a moderate pinch.\n\nA badly placed finger prick is worse than the worst needle I've had, and it doesn't even hurt as long as a bad finger prick.\n\nI'd suggest started by using the needle in your abdomen, and when you're used to it, try side thigh or back of arm. \n\nSometimes they'll bleed, but usually with very little pain. I'd recommend getting those little circle bandaids if you're worried about stains, but I never did.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Your first few times giving yourself shots are always the most difficult to do, but eventually once you do it enough it becomes as mundane an activity as any other. I\u2019ve been a T1 for about 12 years (plus some change), I can tell you it definitely gets easier but you just have to slowly train yourself into a \u201cmind over matter\u201d mentality about it. Remind yourself of a few things: it\u2019s not going to hurt nearly as bad as you think, you need this insulin in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle, you\u2019ve been receiving insulin for a little over a year now, and anything else you can think up that helps you psyche yourself into administering the shot. You just gotta pump yourself up so you can get over that paralyzing anxiety hurdle that stops you cold at the last second.\n\nWhen I was younger, I used to be so afraid of getting shots that I would hide from my mom whenever I knew we were going to eat because I didn\u2019t want to test or do my insulin. Eventually though, I got comfortable with it after I practiced telling myself that it wasn\u2019t going to hurt, and I found that helped so much in reducing the anxiety I was feeling about doing insulin. When I was comfortable with that knowledge, it was only a hop, a skip, and a jump for me to learn to draw up my own shots and start doing them myself.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> For me, I\u2019ve found that meditating before doing it really helps. I know it sounds weird, but if you\u2019re more calm and relaxed it\u2019s actually much easier. I personally would just close my eyes and focus on things opening to get this idea of my skin being more open to the needle, less mind friction I guess. Idk, but it worked for me. Good luck, there\u2019s lots of ways to make the issue better without giving up for sure.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Try and buy a steady shot it helps you get used to giving yourself insulin and goes for about 24.99 on Amazon. I have one and highly recommended it to anyone struggling to give themselves insulin<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Find a few good spots, take a deep breath as it goes in, maybe watch some tv or something to take your mind off it<br><br>\n"}
