I\u2019ve been doing research here and there and see overall great results, mixed with nausea and some bad lows. \n\nHas anyone had success starting one of these drugs and avoiding lows? I\u2019ve seen people mention a total daily insulin reduction of 25%-50%. Maybe I reduce basal down 25 or 50% from the get go and see how much the GLP-1 drug contributes and increase insulin from there if needed? \n\nAny input is much appreciated!</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> I\u2019ve tried both, no issues with lows. I have a tslim and it will just reduce my basal if needed.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Took 4th dose of 0.25mg today. Was on Lantus + Apidra earlier. Take 0.25mg Ozempic weekly, plus 18U Lantus daily + 2-4 units Apidra if BS spikes over 250.   \nPrior to Ozempic, my BS was wild stayed above 250 usually and will get 3-4 hypos in a day if increased either basal or bolus. Before breakfast I would wake up with BS around 130 and upon walking up to freshen up, before doing anything (like within 15 minutes getting out of bed) eating anything BS would spike to 180... ON FASTING STOMACH. It does not happen anymore \\~ high BS spikes are much controlled. Response to short acting insulin is much better. But I get a daily hypo around 6-7 AM if I am not hyper-vigilant. Sucks. Usually I wake up at 9-10 am not before that. But cant afford rn.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> I am a T1 who has been on Saxenda for about 2 months. I use O5 and G6. I have had 2 bad lows in this entire time, and honestly, think that the second one came about as a result of alcohol. I was at a music festival at an all inclusive resort with friends who drink a lot and honestly having 2 drinks a day along with edibles over the course of 4 days, by the last night, I had a horrific low that wasn't even registering on G6 and I had to administer glucagon. I do not think that it was my medication, more that blip in my lifestyle radar. (In my normal life, I have like 2 drinks a week, maybe.) When I got home, I told my endo and she had me change some settings in manual mode, but since then, I haven't had any lows. \n\nI saw my endo and my A1C decreased from 7.1 to 6.6, my TIR is absurd, like 90%, and I have lost about 15 pounds. This is only 2 months in. I did have side effects in the beginning, head aches, queasiness, I vomited twice mostly due to eating too close to bed time (your stomach empties slower), but overall, it's a pretty big help. \n\nI think about it this way. In normies (without obesity, but with a pancreas), there is an organ that secretes all of these hormones to keep us in check. There aren't ONLY (insulin secreting) beta cells in your pancreas, there are 5 cell types that secrete a whole bunch of hormones -glucagon, insulin, somatostatin, ghrelin, and pancreatic polypeptide. For us, our pancreas is destroyed, but by only taking insulin, we are only replacing that one hormone and not the other hormones that have also been taken out as a result of the autoimmune process. \n\nMy endo also had me not go up to the highest dose, which would have been my next step. I am currently at 2.4 mg daily. It is still working well. \n\nGood luck, and hope you don't have any issues finding your med! It's a problem and whatever you do, DO NOT USE COMPOUNDED PRODUCT. Use only the innovator product in pens.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> I kept my basal the same and split bolus for meals, that way I can increase/decrease on the second half as needed. Haven't had any problems. Overall lowered my bolus intake probably 30-40%.<br><br>\n"}

People need to be supportive first and offer advice if it is asked for. \n\nDo not come onto this platform to tell others how they should or should not be handling their illness unless they want your help. There is a lot of literature that goes into the psychosocial aspects of diabetes and these behaviors have consistently been reported as harmful. Offer support, not criticism. \n\nTake care OP and everyone else, we all got this illness.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> I know exactly what you describe as I've been doing insulin for a long time and others, no matter how good their intentions, cannot possibly appreciate, let alone understand, what we go through. I had one doc explain to me how they had a loaner pump filled with saline and wore it for a week so they could understand what it's like to be T1D...\n\nCongratulations, your A1c 7 is very good (that's a 3 month average of about 132 mg/dL). I recall as a high school kid barely able to sit in class for the hour before I had to run to the rest room to urinate and when I was done drink water non-stop before the next class (only 10 minutes between classes). The ridicule I received from classmates was non-stop. But I got through it...\n\nFortunately now I have a sensor and pump and regardless of how poor my control may have been over  50 years ago, I'm fine and enjoy  everything -- It's Wonderful Life.\n\nWhat I still do, is eat smaller amounts of food with meals and snacks to avoid spikes (and larger insulin doses) and continue to be active especially walks, hikes and bike rides.\n\nLive Long and Prosper : }<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> I\u2019m interested in this. I will do a literature search on impact of poor type one control as a child and it causing brittle diabetes as an adult. I\u2019ve not heard of this. \n\nFrom my understanding brittle diabetes is when the sugar swings high and then low frequently. You seem to have good glycaemic control so I wonder if something else is at play.<br><br>\n"}

When there is no longer stored fat it turns to muscle for energy. I believe in type 1 diabetics the body does not detect insulin that is injected manually or through an insulin pump or other means. I believe in a normal person without type 1 diabetes it's always a counterbalance insulin glucose insulin glucose whenever needed. I believe for type 1 diabetics because the body does not detect the insulin but knows it needs energy it will start breaking down stored fat or muscle whichever is available. That causes your blood sugar to rise. The liver does have stored glucose most of the time I believe that is for emergency situations. I think sometimes that is why some people that have hypoglycemia events that are real bad can come out of it briefly and sometimes are able to get something like sugar or whatever. But it's definitely something you cannot count on because sometimes it doesn't happen for everyone. So just be careful small microbolices like others have recommended is the best bet.<br><br>\n"}

With all that water came me having to pee A LOT I would go almost every 10-20 minutes school was absolute hell they refused to let me refill my water bottle or to let me go to the bathroom I had to hold it until I was in so much pain I was in tears I would go to the nurse and tell her something was wrong but she just told me that I was trying to skip class and go home early I would go in the bathroom stall and cry my eyes out this went on for pretty much two months until the end of November came around it was thanksgiving break and I was home from school nobody was home that day so I took that opportunity to drink everything in sight until suddenly around 3 o,clock I started to have feelings of acid reflux or so I thought they were so bad and painful I called my older sister on my iPad and told her how much pain I was in and that I wanted somebody to come home of course she couldn\u2019t because she lives in a different state but she was the only one that would answer my calls after about one hour of talking to her I hung up and took a nap I woke back up at 5 with the worst feeling in my chest like burning and acid I coul barely move my body without the paw increasing so I crawled out into the living room and still nobody was home at that point I crawled onto the couch and laid there almost lifeless until someone arrived at 8 I told my grandma that I wasn\u2019t feeling good snatch that I think I should go to the ER and she replied with that they would say the same exact thing that it was just acid reflux and it would be a waste of time and money. I rolled over and cried into a pillow I accidentally cried myself to sleep and woke up around 10 and starter to vomit over and over I eventually stopped and crawled back into bed for the night The night was restless I would wake up every one hour sweating hot, needing to go to the bathroom, and in so much pain I would throw up until I had nothing left in my stomach this happened all night until 4 am when I woke up unable to breathe I was gasping for air so much that it felt like my chest would burst I made it into my grandparents room and woke her up telling her I couldn\u2019t breathe she woke up and decided to take me because she thought I had covid so we rushed into the ER I was barely clinging to Consciousness and was so shaky I could barely stand I was still holding back the urge to vomit a really kind nurse asked me if I needed a wheelchair and I nodded my head as that was all I could do after a few moments another lady came out to take me to get my vitals she was the most horrible lady I\u2019ve ever met she looked me up and down with disgusting her eyes and asked me why I was in a wheelchair I was so shocked I didn\u2019t know what to say not that I could say anything at all once we were in a room she repeatedly told me to calm down and stop breathing so fast and hard I tried to mumble at the words I\u2019m sorry to her but my voice was cracking and my throat was so dry she looked at me and told me she didn\u2019t know what was wrong with me\nSuddenly another doctor came in in the moment he came in he had a look on his face that he knew some thing that we didn\u2019t he immediately asked for a glucose meter and when he checked my blood sugar his jaw dropped my sugar was around 900 she looked around everyone in the room and immediately started asking them to get an ambulance on the way right now he told my grandma that he didn\u2019t know how I was still conscious The ambulance arrived and it took me an hour away to a children\u2019s hospital where I was put in the PICU for seven days it was really hard I had a lot to learn about how my life is about to change I had to have help with almost everything walking and going to the bathroom eating etc. after seven days I got to go home and I\u2019ve been doing great ever since I was dying on a cellular level and not one person cared up until it was almost to late I just want to say please take you kids seriously they know when something is wrong.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> [removed]<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> This is so similar to my story, that it made me tear up.

Any tips?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> High calorie, carbs and protein. Be consistent and exercise regularly if you\u2019re looking to build some muscle. Insulin has been a bit of a cheat code for me with weight gain and significant increase in muscle mass. Body builders tend to use insulin as a steroid to boost their muscle gains, even when they aren\u2019t diabetic. Just make sure you eat!<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> im also trying to gain back the weight i lost from DKA. im trouble understanding if its bad BG control or not eating enough but i feel like i do. how high is to high to gain weight and does it matter if its a spike or staying high? i was diagnosed in march so maybe my bodys still adjusting?<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Take more insulin is probably a portion of the answer.  (Obviously the other portion is eating more, too!)\n\nNot sure what your exact experience will be, but it may involve taking multiple shots/boluses for a large meal.\n\nPrebolusing helps, but if you take a large shot on a prebolus, you can go low before the meal, so if you split it, that can help to have enough on board when the meals starts to prevent wild swings.<br><br>\n"}
{"id": "rl5z5p", "text": "<div class='post' style='user-select:none;'>\n  <h2>Post</h2>\n  <p>How do you tell the difference between why the insulin isn\u2019t working?\nSo I have only been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for just over a year now. I\u2019m on humulog on the tandem tslim and dexcom.  It\u2019s hard to describe my question but how do you know it your insulin isn\u2019t working due to a bad site or the insulin is dead? Or you just are being a little resistance at the moment? Like is it really just trial and error and just guess which reason is why you (I) won\u2019t come down? How do you tell the difference between all those? And or if the meal I have just sucked and my timing of blousing was just crappy?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Comments:</h2>\n  <b>Comment 1:</b> Im skeptical of \"acute insulin resistance\". The insulin is doing something, it's fighting a protein spike, fighting delayed carbs because of fat, fighting dehydration, or fighting blood sugar from stress.\n\nEnough insulin will bring it down. Check the site, if insulin isn't leaking out there's a good chance it's getting in. Wait a few hours and change it if it's still fucked.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> With my daughter, we always think site first.  How long has it been on?  If you just put it on, maybe the cannula is bent.  Has it been on for 5 days, probably site has gone bad.  Did you just change the reservoir, how long has the insulin been open?  We also keep one or two unopened pens, just for emergencies.  If we think it is the insulin, get out a pen a d see what happens.  Really it is trial and error, but depending on site age and when you opened your last vial, you can make a good guess.  We have not run into her suddenly having Issues with insulin working g.  Hope that helps.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> Take your hands and gently wipe them all around the adhesive on your site. If you smell insulin, in your hands, that is a leak/tunneling. Change your site.\n\nIf your site hurts a lot, change your site.\n\nIf your site feels loose, change your site.\n\nSites often aren\u2019t suitable anymore well before they seem totally ready to come off. My sites can last anywhere from 2-5 days depending on where they are and what I\u2019m doing. Usually 3-4.\n\nMake sure you have enough infusion sets so you aren\u2019t unnecessarily rationing infusion sets if your doctors and insurance will allow it.\n\nWith respect to your last question, site issues are easiest to diagnose. The rest is much harder. Count carbs, pay attention to if your meal was fatty or had lots of protein in it (may require more insulin), and whether you have been actively lately.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 4:</b> Rage bolus. \n\nI'm kidding but for real, if a rage bolus doesn't do anything then the insulin is bad. It's a horrible idea and we all know we shouldn't do it... that said, I am who I am and I'll rage if I want to. But in all seriousness, figuring out what is wrong is not as important as getting blood sugar in range. If something isn't working, I will rip it all out and start fresh instead of experimenting on myself and staying high.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 5:</b> Give yourself an injection with the same insulin - do you come down? If you do it probably the site, if you don\u2019t it\u2019s probably the insulin or infection.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 6:</b> I am ten and a half days late to your party.  Here's a cupcake.\n\nSo if you notice rather than a series of checkpoints each poster at this point only states one thing to check (the funniest always being insulin is bad.  insulin is good for 28 days out of the fridge).  \n\nSo, is this a regular issue?  What sites do you use?  Autosoft, varisoft, trusteel?  Days between rotations?  Build?  Gender (and biological gender because periods matter).  Do you drink heavily/binge drinking?  Drug use?  Type of carbs usually consumed?  Hours between large meals?\n\nIf you aren't comfortable answering some of these (look at my history, I have more than once admitted to being a T1 alcoholic), DM me.  but some of the advice on this thread is one pronged and I feel like you need a troubleshooting guide.<br><br>\n"}

Typically I get three solid days out of a site.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 3:</b> The reason you need to change your site every 2-3 days is because scar tissue starts to become a major issue if you regularly don\u2019t rotate sites. Nobody is forcing you to change sites more often, but eventually you will see random absorption issues where your insulin isn\u2019t working as fast as it should. \n\nBTW, your pump also logs how often you change sites and reservoirs. When your Endo pulls the report, it is a pretty prominent number... Some endos won\u2019t care, but don\u2019t be surprised if you get asked about it at an upcoming visit.<br><br>\n"}

Here is one Garmin watch face:\nhttps://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/8fab3746-f56f-4b41-b3c7-5f4aaeaed6c9#0\nThese generally use a third-party phone app (usually xDrip) instead of Dexcom's official phone app.\n\nSearch the Garmin store for Dexcom / Nightscout / xDrip to see more related stuff - a lot of them have links that help you get it set up. I don't know all the specifics since I don't have a Garmin watch yet, but I was looking to buy one soon and getting my Dexcom data on the watch is pretty important to me too!<br><br>\n"}

I\u2019m not of legal drinking age yet so I haven\u2019t gone balls to the walls or anything, but I\u2019ve also been trying to safely figure out how to do this. \n\nDefinitely go into it with something substantial in your stomach. I usually go for something fatty and protein based, eggs and hash browns are my go to. Stay hydrated before/during/after. Basic drinking protocol. \n\nI usually try to make sure I have a CGM in and working so I can spot trouble ahead of time. The biggest problem you\u2019ll probably have is lows, probably hours after drinking while your liver is still busy metabolizing what you\u2019ve drank. You can either be really slack about your blousing during the night, I\u2019ll bolus for any meals I have, but small stuff, candy, mixers, I\u2019ll usually leave until the end of the night. I usually try to do this by including a mixed drink or cup of punch a for every few beers/shots I have. If this seems too cavalier for you, I\u2019ve had lots of success having 15-25 carbs of a snack before bed. I try to pack it in whatever bag I take with me, usually a ziplock bag of oreos or thin mints. I\u2019d also recommend an emergency snack just in case you do dip and have nothing on hand. \n\nThese strategies are really important because glucagons do not work while your body is processing alcohol. When in doubt, aim high, because this isn\u2019t the time to pass out because of a hypo. Have somebody that can recongnize your symptoms really well, this is also really tricky because being low looks and sounds and feels a lot like being drunk. Godspeed.<br><br>\n  <b>Comment 2:</b> Insulin affects liver release of glycogen which may cause low. Also according to some studies but not all that confirmed is alcohol affects insulin sensitivity. So you may have to give more increasing risk of hypos. Be aware you may not recognize hypos while drinking m. So you should eat more food and risk being high vs low.<br><br>\n"}

Long story short, I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes after I finally got around to completing standard blood work from an annual physical.
